# Alokai Docs Starter

Welcome to the Alokai Docs! If you're creating a new Alokai integration, this is the place to start. 

It extends our [Base Layer](https://docs.alokai.com/community/contributing/docs/base-layer) to give you all of the modules, components, and features available in the deployed Alokai docs.

Then, when you're ready to publish your content, we'll work with you to get add the `content` folder of this project as a remote Git source for the Alokai docs.

## Tips

You can use the rest of this project to preview your content locally, but any components/layouts/composables/etc. will not be available to the published docs.

If you need additional functionality, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.alokai.com) and we'll work with you to get it added to the docs base layer and make it available to all of our docs projects.

But remember - if you're publishing through the Alokai docs, only your `content` folder will be pulled into the docs.

### Place images directly in the `content` folder

If you need to use images in your content, you can place them directly in the `content` folder. Then, you can reference them in your content using the relative path.
