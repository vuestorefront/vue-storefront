## Store

Cart Store is designed to handle all actions related the shopping cart.

### State

```js
  state: {
    itemsAfterPlatformTotals: {},
    platformTotals: null,
    platformTotalSegments: null,
    cartIsLoaded: false,
    cartServerToken: '', // server side ID to synchronize with Backend (for example Magento)
    shipping: [],
    payment: [],
    cartItemsHash: '',
    bypassCount: 0,
    cartItems: [] // TODO: check if it's properly namespaced
  },
```

Cart state is automatically loaded from `localForage` collection after page has been loaded whenever `core/components/blocks/Microcart.vue` is included. The cart state is loaded by dispatching `cart/load` action and [stored automatically by any change to the cart state](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/index.js#L118).

The cart state data:

- `itemsAfterPlatformTotals` - helper collection, dictionary where the key is Magento cart item `item_id` that stores the totals information per item - received from Magento; it's automatically populated when `config.cart.synchronize_totals` is enabled;
- `platformTotals` - similarly to above item, here we have the full totals from Magento for the current shopping cart. These collections are populated by [`cart/syncTotals`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/modules/cart/actions.js#L49) and the event handler for [`servercart-after-totals`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/modules/cart/index.js#L30)
- `cartIsLoaded` (bool) - true after dispatching `cart/load`
- `shipping` - (object) currently selected shipping method - only when NOT using `cart.synchronize_totals` (if so, the shipping and payment's data comes from Magento2),
- `payment` - (object) currently selected shipping method - only when NOT using `cart.synchronize_totals` (if so, the shipping and payment's data comes from Magento2),
- `cartItems` - collection of the cart items; the item format is the same as described in [ElasticSearch Data formats](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/ElasticSearch%20data%20formats.md) - the `product` class; the only difference is that the (int) `qty` field is added

### Events

The following events are published from `cart` store:

- `EventBus.$emit('cart-after-itemchanged', { item: cartItem })` - executed after [`servercart-after-itemupdated`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/modules/cart/index.js#L108) - after server cart sync, that signalize the specific shopping cart item has been changed; `Microcart/Product.vue` component is subscribed to this event to refresh the shopping cart UI
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-before-add', { product: item })` - fired after product has been added to the cart,
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-before-save', { items: state.cartItems })` - fired after the product cart has been saved,
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-before-delete', { items: state.cartItems })` - the event fired before the cart item is going to be deleted with the current cart state (before item is deleted)
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-after-delete', { items: state.cartItems })` - the event fired before the cart item has been deleted with the current cart state (after item is deleted)
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-before-itemchanged', { item: record })` - item called before the specific item properties are going to be changed; for example called when [`servercart-after-itemupdated`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/modules/cart/index.js#L108) is going to change the `server_item_id` property
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-after-itemchanged', { item: record })` - item called after the specific item properites has been changed; for example called when [`servercart-after-itemupdated`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/c43b2966a9ae10661e5a62b10445403ed9789b32/core/store/modules/cart/index.js#L108) is going to change the `server_item_id` property
- `EventBus.$emit('application-after-loaded')` - event called after `cart/load` action has been dispatched to notify that cart is being available,
- `EventBus.$emit('cart-after-updatetotals', { platformTotals: totals, platformTotalSegments: platformTotalSegments })` - event called after the totals from Magento has been synchronized with current state; it's going to be emitted only when `cart.synchronize_totals` option is enabled.

### Actions

The cart store provides following public actions:

#### `disconnect (context)`

Helper method used to clear the current server cart id (used for cart synchronization)

#### `clear (context)`

This method is called after order has been placed to empty the `cartItems` collection and create the new server cart when the `cart.synchronize_totals` is set to true

#### `save (context)`

Method used to save the cart to the `localForage` browser collection

#### `sync (context, { forceClientState = false })`

This method is used to synchronize the current state of the cart items back and forth between server and current client state. When the `forceClientState` is set to false the communication is one-way only (client -> server). This action is called automatically on any shopping cart change when the `cart.synchronize` is set to true.

#### `syncTotals (context, { forceClientState = false })`

Method is called whenever the cart totals should have been synchronized with the server (after `serverPull`). This method overrides local shopping cart grand totals and specific item values (for example prices after discount).

#### `connect (context, { guestCart = false })`

Action is dispatched to create the server cart and store the cart id (for further synchronization)

#### `load (context)`

This method loads the cart items from `localForage` browser state management.

#### `getItem ({ commit, dispatch, state }, sku)`

This action is used for search the particular item in the shopping cart (by SKU)

#### `addItem ({ commit, dispatch, state }, { productToAdd, forceServerSilence = false })`

This action is used to add the `productToAdd` to the cart, if `config.cart.synchronize` is set to true the next action subsequently called will be `serverPull` to synchronize the cart. The event `cart-before-add` is called whenever new product lands in the shopping cart. The option `forceServerSilence` is used to bypass the server synchronization and it's used for example then the item is added during the ... sync process to avoid circular synchronization cycles.

#### `removeItem ({ commit, dispatch }, product)`

As you may imagine :) This action simply removes the product from the shopping cart and synchronizes the server cart when set. You must at least specify the `product.sku`.

#### `updateQuantity ({ commit, dispatch }, { product, qty, forceServerSilence = false })`

This method is called whenever user changes the quantity of product in the cart (called from `Microcart.vue`). The parameter `qty` is the new quantity of product and by using `forceServerSilence` you may control if the server cart synchronization is being executed or not.

#### `updateItem ({ commit }, { product })`

Updates item properties.

#### `syncPaymentMethods (context)`

Gets a list of payment methods from the backend and saves them to `cart.payment` store state.

#### `syncShippingMethods (context, address)`

Gets a list of shipping methods from the backend and saves them to `cart.shipping` store state. Country ID is passed to this method in a mandatory `address` parameter.

#### `syncTotals (context, methodsData)`

This method sends request to the backend to collect cart totals. It calls different backend endpoints depending on if payment and shipping methods information is available or not.

### Getters

All state members should have been accessed only by getters. Please take a look at the state reference for data formats

- `getCartToken` - get the current cart token, if empty it does mean we need to call an action `cart/connect` prior to sync with the server,
- `getLastSyncDate` - this is an integer, timestamp of the last shopping cart sync with the server
- `getLastTotalsSyncDate` - integer, timestamp of the last totals sync with the server,
- `getShippingMethod` - object, gets currently selected shipping method in the Checkout,
- `getPaymentMethod` - object, gets current payment method selected in the checkout,
- `getLastCartHash` - get the last saved hash/HMAC of the cart items + server token that let's you track the changes of the shipping cart. Hash is being saved by the server sync,
- `getCurrentCartHash` - get the current hash/HMAC of the cart items + server token. Coparing it to the `getLastCartHash` value let you know if we need a server sync or not,
- `isCartHashChanged` - comparing the `getLastCartHash` with the `getCurrentCartHash` in order to verify if we need a server sync or not,
- `isSyncRequired` - checking if the `isCartHashChanged` is true OR if this is the first sync attempt (after the SSR),
- `isTotalsSyncRequired` - same as `isSyncRequired` but for the totals (not the cart items),
- `isCartHashEmptyOrChanged` - checks if `isCartHashChanged` or empty,
- `getCartItems` - array of products in the shopping cart,
- `isTotalsSyncEnabled` - check if the `config.cart.synchronize` is true + if we're online + if this is CSR request,
- `isCartConnected` - check if the `getCartToken` is not empty - which means the `cart/connect` action has been called and we're OK to sync with the server,
- `isCartSyncEnabled` - the same as `isTotalsSyncEnabled` but for totals (`config.cart.synchronize_totals` flag),
- `getTotals` - array with the total segments,
- `getItemsTotalQuantity` - get the sum of all the items in the shopping cart,
- `getCoupon` - get the currently applied discount code,
