## How to add a custom checkout step

We now show an example of how to add a new step to the checkout page of Vue Storefront.

The step is named `NewStep` and is placed just after the `PersonalDetails` step; changing the step's name and position requires small modifications to the procedure.

### First, create the NewStep component

1. **Create the NewStep component** according to your needs. To do it quickly, make a copy of the `PersonalDetails` component, name it `NewStep` and customize it.

2. **Customize the sendDataToCheckout method** of the `NewStep` component so that it emits the event `checkout-after-newStep`; for example:
```javascript
    sendDataToCheckout () {
      this.$bus.$emit('checkout-after-newStep', this.newStep, this.$v)
    }
```

3. **Call the sendDataToCheckout method** when the button to the next section is clicked. This could be achieved in the template like this:
```vue
    <button-full
      @click.native="sendDataToCheckout"
    >
```

### Then, modify the checkout component

1. **Insert the NewStep component in the checkout template** at the desired position. For example, you could place it between the Personal Details and Shipping steps:
```vue
  <personal-details class="line relative" :is-active="activeSection.personalDetails" :focused-field="focusedField"/>
  <new-step class="line relative" :is-active="activeSection.newStep">
  <shipping class="line relative" :is-active="activeSection.shipping" v-if="!isVirtualCart"/>
  <payment class="line relative" :is-active="activeSection.payment"/>
  <order-review class="line relative" :is-active="activeSection.orderReview"/>
```

2. **Listen for the checkout-after-newStep event** by adding the following listener to the `beforeMount()` function:
```javascript
    this.$bus.$on('checkout-after-newStep', this.onAfterNewStep)
```

3. **Specify how to jump from the previous step to NewStep**. Modify the `onAfterPersonalDetails()` method in order to activate the `newStep` section instead of the `shipping` step:
```javascript
    onAfterPersonalDetails (receivedData, validationResult) {
      this.personalDetails = receivedData
      this.validationResults.personalDetails = validationResult
      this.activateSection('newStep') // show the new step
      this.savePersonalDetails()
      this.focusedField = null
    }
```
This is assuming that the new checkout step follows the Personal Details step; if this is not the case, you will need to modify the `onAfter` metod of whatever step precedes `NewStep`.

4. **Specify how to jump from NewStep to the next step** by creating the method `onAfterNewStep`; in this example, the next step is the shipping form:
```javascript
    onAfterNewStep (receivedData, validationResult) {
      this.newStep = receivedData
      this.validationResults.newStep = validationResult
      this.activateSection('shipping') // change 'shipping' to whatever you want the next step to be
      this.saveNewStep() // include this line only if newStep has state
    }
```
Note that calling `activateSection('shipping')` is what ultimately shows the next checkout step to the user.

5. **If needed, save NewStep state** by defining a non-empty method `saveNewStep()`; for example:
```javascript
    saveNewStep () {
      this.$store.dispatch('checkout/saveNewStep', this.newStep)
    },
```
This is needed only ifÂ your new step has state, in which case you will also need to define the `checkout/saveNewStep` action in Vuex.


## Store

The Checkout Store is designed to handle the passage from user's cart to actual order; it defines actions such as saving the information given by the user during checkout, and placing the order.

### State

```js
  state: {
    order: {},
    personalDetails: {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
      emailAddress: '',
      password: '',
      createAccount: false
    },
    shippingDetails: {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
      country: '',
      streetAddress: '',
      apartmentNumber: '',
      city: '',
      state: '',
      region_id: 0,
      zipCode: '',
      phoneNumber: '',
      shippingMethod: ''
    },
    paymentDetails: {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
      company: '',
      country: '',
      streetAddress: '',
      apartmentNumber: '',
      city: '',
      state: '',
      region_id: 0,
      zipCode: '',
      phoneNumber: '',
      taxId: '',
      paymentMethod: '',
      paymentMethodAdditional: {}
    },
    isThankYouPage: false,
    modifiedAt: 0
  }
```

The state of the Checkout module contains both the [Order object](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/models/order.schema.json) and the information given by the user during the checkout process, to be stored for further use in the `localForage`.

The state is modified by [`placeOrder`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/1793aaa7afc89b3f08e443f40dd5c6131dd477ba/core/store/modules/checkout/actions.js#L11) action and [`load`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/1793aaa7afc89b3f08e443f40dd5c6131dd477ba/core/store/modules/checkout/actions.js#L41) which loads the state from browser database.

The category state data:

- `order` - this is the last order to be placed, the [schema is defined](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/models/order.schema.json) in Ajv compliant format
- `shippingDetails`, `paymentDetails` - the address information provided by the user during the [Checkout](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/pages/Checkout.vue).

### Actions

The cart store provides following public actions:

#### `placeOrder (context, { order })`

Action called by `Checkout.vue` to complete the order. Data object is validated against the [order schema](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/models/order.schema.json), stored within the `localForage` collection by subseqent call of [`order/placeOrder`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/1793aaa7afc89b3f08e443f40dd5c6131dd477ba/core/store/modules/order/actions.js#L12)

#### `savePersonalDetails ({ commit }, personalDetails)`

Stores the personal Details (the format is exactly the same as this store `state.personalDetails`) for later use in the browser's storage

#### `saveShippingDetails ({ commit }, shippingDetails)`

Stores the shipping Details (the format is exactly the same as this store `state.shippingDetails`) for later use in the browser's storage

#### `savePaymentDetails ({ commit }, paymentDetails)`

Stores the payment Details (the format is exactly the same as this store `state.paymentDetails`) for later use in the browser's storage

#### `load ({ commit })`

Load the current state from the `localForage`
