# Database tool

Vue Storefront gets all of its data from [vue-storefront-api](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api) endpoints, operating on top of the Elasticsearch data store.

If you installed the project using `yarn installer`  command,  the database has been set up, data imported from demo-dump, and everything should be just fine.

After more extensive data operations, like custom imports using [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront) or [magento1-vsbridge](https://github.com/divanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge), there is a need to reindex the Elasticsearch and set up the proper metadata for fields.


The main reason youâ€™ll know you must reindex the database is the following error you get from the `vue-storefront` console:

```json
Error: {"root_cause":[{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"Fielddata is disabled on text fields by default. Set fielddata=true on [created_at] in order to load fielddata in memory by uninverting the inverted index. Note that this can however use significant memory. Alternatively use a keyword field instead."}],"type":"search_phase_execution_exception","reason":"all shards failed","phase":"query","grouped":true,"failed_shards":[{"shard":0,"index":"vue_storefront_catalog_1521776807","node":"xIOeZW2lTwaprGXh6YLyCA","reason":{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"Fielddata is disabled on text fields by default. Set fielddata=true on [created_at] in order to load fielddata in memory by uninverting the inverted index. Note that this can however use significant memory. Alternatively use a keyword field instead."}}]}
```

In this case, there is a db tool inside your local `vue-storefront-api` installation to the rescue.

## Re-indexing an existing database

Please go to `vue-storefront-api` directory and run:

```bash
yarn db rebuild
```

This command will:

- Reindex your currently set (in the `config/local.json` config file) Elasticsearch index to temp-one.
- Put the right Elasticsearch mappings on top of the temp index.
- Drop the original index.
- Create the alias with original name to the temp one so you can use the original name without any reference changes.


You can specify different (than this set in `config/local.json`) index name by running:

```bash
yarn db rebuild -- --indexName=custom_index_name
```

## Creating the new index

If you want to create a new, empty index please run:

```bash
yarn db new
```

This tool will drop your current index and create a new, empty one with all the metafields set.

You can specify different (than this set in `config/local.json`) index name by running:

```bash
yarn db rebuild -- --indexName=custom_index_name
```

## Changing the index structure / adding new fields / changing the types

If you want to extend the Elasticsearch data structures or map some particular field types, for example, after getting kind of this error:

```
[{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"Fielddata is disabled on text fields by default. Set fielddata=true on [created_at] in order to load fielddata in memory by uninverting the inverted index. Note that this can however use significant memory. Alternatively use a keyword field instead."}]
```

Please do change the ES schema by modifying:

- [config/elastic.schema.product.extension.json](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/master/config/elastic.schema.product.extension.json)
- [config/elastic.schema.attribute.extension.json](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/master/config/elastic.schema.attribute.extension.json)
- [config/elastic.schema.taxrate.extension.json](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/master/config/elastic.schema.taxrate.extension.json)

The format is compliant with [ES DSL for schema modifications](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-elasticsearch-mapping-introduction)

After the changes, run the following indexing command:

```bash
yarn db rebuild
```
