## 0. Introduction
_Elasticsearch_ is the choice of _Vue Storefront_ for its data store as naturally as there must be reasons behind this. 
By its name, you can deduce _Elastic_ to mean scalable, extendable, distributed and type-agnostic which is great in this big data era while _Search_ implies indexing, filter, _Read_ among _CRUD_ which shows its focus. So far so good, then, what is all this fuss about Elasticsearch? 

_Elasticsearch_ is a full-text search and analysis engine based on _Apache Lucene_ by its definition. It employs inverted index which means _documents_ are indexed via all the unique _terms_ occurred and the ability to take advantage of assembling the per-field data structures can explain why _Elasticsearch_ is ultrafast. 

The other strong point is, notably, it's inborn distributed. Experience from a single node elasticsearch and multiple clusters of it is almost identical and doing so is painless as it works out of the box. There are virtually tons of points to make for why _Elasticsearch_ is your elected mid-stop between datahouse and storefront. Now let's move on to how it's implemented in _Vue Storefront_. 

_Vue Storefront_ defines itself backend-agnostic PWA e-commerce solution where _Vue Storefront_ is a storefront as the name dictates, and _Elasticsearch_ works as a datastore for _catalog_ and its sibling data such as _taxrule_, _products_ and so on. When a storefront requests information about a product, then it fetches _index_ of _documents_ about the _term_ queried from _Elasticsearch_ without traversing it to the source web store (be it Magento) so it skips all the heavy loading of the store whose database behind also is not concered which makes customers happy for pleasant experience. 

Without much further ado, let's see what's served as an appetizer :)
<br />
<br />


## 1. Now ES7 is also supported in VSF
_Elasticsearch_ has been under massive upgrade with interval so intense as only two weeks exist between release of `6.7` and `7.0`. Can you feel the heat of the community? While we can enjoy the improvement and enhancement of the _Elastic Stack_, there is a list to check before smooth upgrade. And it also works just the same way as you need to fix _Vue Storefront_ stack for compatibility with _Elasticsearch 7.x_. 

As _Vue Storefront_ stack is mostly associated with _Elasticsearch_ through _Vue Storefront API_, you should fix files for _Vue Storefront API_ along with a few callers for it from _Vue Storefront_. However, most changes take place in core parts of the platform on purpose so your labor will have been minimized for your inner peace. Still, _configs_ and/or _migration_ need fixes where it's necessary. This recipe walks you through how to do it one by one. 


### 1. Preparation
 - You need to have [setup _Vue Storefront_ stack](setup) including _Vue Storefront API_. 
 - ES7 is supported from _Vue Storefront_ version `1.11` and up. You should have it accordingly. 
 - ES7 is supported from _Vue Storefront API_ version `1.11` and up. You should have it accordingly too. 
 - ES7 is supported from _mage2vuestorefront_ with branch `feature/es7`. You should have it too.  
:::tip NOTE
How to download the latest `1.11` via `git` is explained in [_Protip_](#secret-1-how-to-upgrade-to-1-11-technically-foolproof-approach)
:::


### 2. Recipe
 0. You should fix `docker-compose.nodejs.yml` file as linked _Elasticsearch_ container should be updated like below : 

<div id="d-nodejs-yml">

</div>
<script>
var dNodejsYml = Diff2Html.getPrettyHtml(
  '--- a/docker-compose.nodejs.yml\n+++ b/docker-compose.nodejs.yml\n@@ -6,7 +6,7 @@ services:\n       context: .\n       dockerfile: docker/vue-storefront-api/Dockerfile\n     depends_on:\n-      - es1\n+      - es7\n       - redis\n     env_file: docker/vue-storefront-api/default.env\n     environment:\n',
  {inputFormat: 'diff', showFiles: false, matching: 'none', outputFormat: 'line-by-line'}
);
document.getElementById('d-nodejs-yml').innerHTML = dNodejsYml;
</script>


 1. `docker-compose` for _Elasticsearch 7_ is included in `1.11`. Let's run the docker container for _Elasticsearch 7_ from **Vue Storefront API root path** as follows : 
 ```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.elastic7.yml -f docker-compose.nodejs.yml up
 ```
:::tip TIP
You can run it in the _detach_ mode with option flag `-d` as in 
 ```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.elastic7.yml -f docker-compose.nodejs.yml up -d
 ```

 2. You will see the screen as below :

 ```
 :vhs: You may also watch it in [bash playback :movie_camera:](https://asciinema.org/a/NcfdFuMkJ5LWzVbgb7m35coOV)

 You might notice the script spawns two containers, one of which is for `redis` while the other is for `elasticsearch 7`. (`kibana` container is optional from `1.11`)

 3. Visit `localhost:9200` from your browser then it should print likewise as follows :
```text
{
  "name" : "be374d24f82e",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "3Gk6anHkQU--5TmenJkdrw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.3.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "docker",
    "build_hash" : "1c1faf1",
    "build_date" : "2019-09-06T14:40:30.409026Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.1.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

 4. Fix `local.json` to update configuration for `indexTypes` and `apiVersion` under `elasticsearch` as follows :

<div id="d-local-json">

</div>
<script>
var dLocalJson = Diff2Html.getPrettyHtml(
  '--- a/config/local.json\n+++ b/config/local.json\n@@ -2,8 +2,6 @@\n     \"host\": \"localhost\",\n     \"port\": 9200,\n     \"protocol\": \"http\",\n-    \"user\": \"elastic\",\n-    \"password\": \"changeme\",\n     \"min_score\": 0.01,\n     \"indices\": [\n       \"vue_storefront_catalog\",\n@@ -13,10 +11,11 @@\n     \"indexTypes\": [\n       \"product\",\n       \"category\",\n-      \"cms\",\n+      \"cms_block\",\n+      \"cms_page\",\n       \"attribute\",\n       \"taxrule\",\n       \"review\"\n     ],\n-    \"apiVersion\": \"5.6\"\n-  }, \n+    \"apiVersion\": \"7.1\"\n+  }, ',
  {inputFormat: 'diff', showFiles: false, matching: 'none', outputFormat: 'line-by-line'}
);
document.getElementById('d-local-json').innerHTML = dLocalJson;
</script>


 5. Once _Elasticsearch 7_ instance is up and running, then run the new script which creates index with the proper data types of fields applied.
```bash
yarn db7 new
```

This is because you should newly put mapping for _Elasticsearch 7_ which only allows one _document_ per single _index_. [more info](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes-7.0.html)

 The screen spits log as follows : 
```bash
yarn run v1.21.1
$ node scripts/db7.js new
** Hello! I am going to create NEW ES index
Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception
Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception

Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception
Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception
Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception
Public index alias does not exists aliases_not_found_exception
Done in 2.27s.
```
 :vhs: You may also watch it in [bash playback :movie_camera:](https://asciinema.org/a/UErONnmqK1m2EFNkWRrG0E6p4)

Don't worry about `aliases_not_found_exception`. It simply means it failed to cleanse the orphaned aliases since there was none to delete in the first place.

 6. Check if the mapping has been created successfully from the terminal against Elasticsearch API : 
```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty=true'
```

 Result should be shown as : 
```bash
{
  "vue_storefront_catalog_cms_block" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "properties" : {
        "creation_time" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis"
        },
        "id" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "identifier" : {
          "type" : "keyword"
        },
        "update_time" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "vue_storefront_catalog_review" : {
    "mappings" : { }
  },
  "vue_storefront_catalog_taxrule" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "properties" : {
        "id" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "rates" : {
          "properties" : {
            "rate" : {
              "type" : "float"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },

# ... abridged ...

  "vue_storefront_catalog_category" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "properties" : {
        "created_at" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis"
        },
        "is_active" : {
          "type" : "boolean"
        },
        "parent_id" : {
          "type" : "integer"
        },
        "position" : {
          "type" : "integer"
        },
        "product_count" : {
          "type" : "integer"
        },
        "slug" : {
          "type" : "keyword"
        },
        "updated_at" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis"
        },
        "url_key" : {
          "type" : "keyword"
        },
        "url_path" : {
          "type" : "keyword"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
``` 
You can find each index has only its single mapping with convention `${indexName}_${entityType}`.

 7. Next thing is, pumping data from source web store to the newly created ES7 index. Go to _mage2vuestorefront_ directory and fix `apiVersion` inside `elasticsearch` node in `config.js`.

<div id="d-config-js">

</div>
<script>
var dConfigJs = Diff2Html.getPrettyHtml(
  '--- a/src/config.js\n+++ b/src/config.js\n@@ -61,7 +61,7 @@ module.exports = {\n   },\n \n   elasticsearch: {\n-    apiVersion: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_API_VERSION || \'5.6\'\n+    apiVersion: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_API_VERSION || \'7.1\' \n   },\n \n   redis: {\n',
  {inputFormat: 'diff', showFiles: false, matching: 'none', outputFormat: 'line-by-line'}
);
document.getElementById('d-config-js').innerHTML = dConfigJs;
</script>

 With this change in `config.js`, `mage2vuestorefront` knows how to deal with your _Elasticsearch_ whose version is higher than `6`. 

 8. Now teach the machine your configuration using shell `ENV` as following example : 
 ```bash
 export TIME_TO_EXIT=2000
 export MAGENTO_CONSUMER_KEY=lv1unkldzkcex68l3eojut4j66qqho8w
 export MAGENTO_CONSUMER_SECRET=zhkuqvweo0bsg14noujqje49x3wht0qr
 export MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN=z6ftgc5005212bc6lnszxa7d7ocl8hgc
 export MAGENTO_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=h8tikjq9sz7tqm6hyhdfgs96krb6qzyk
 
 export MAGENTO_URL=http://local.magento/rest # Replace the url with your Magento 2 URL
 export INDEX_NAME=vue_storefront_catalog # This will be the base name of the index we use
 ```
 Type them in a shell then your `ENV` remembers the variables until the session expires. 
 
 :::tip TIP
 If you don't know how to get those credentials, please take a look at [data import](/guide/cookbook/data-import.html#_2-2-recipe-b-using-on-premise)
 :::
 
 9. Run your worker to pump it up from source web store to Elasticsearch : 
```bash
node --harmony cli.js categories --removeNonExistent=true
```

Screen will show you logs as follows : 
```bash

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

10. Repeat this process until you are done importing entities with all the indices you mapped to _Elasticsearch_ before such as _products_, _attributes_, _taxrules_ and more as follows : 
```bash
node --harmony cli.js productcategories
node --harmony cli.js attributes --removeNonExistent=true

Now you are ready to launch your Vue Storefront shop powered by _Elasticsearch 7_. 

11. Run the following to launch your shop at _Vue Storefront_ root path.
```sh
docker-compose up 
```
You are all good to go!


### 3. Peep into the kitchen (what happens internally)
_Elasticsearch_ has been through intensive updates ceaselessly. Mostly, it's gradual changes with backward compatibility so it won't have a big impact even if you upgrade one to another. This time, however, upgrade to `7.x` has a few breaking changes, one notably of which is, multiple `_type` is not allowed for an index. 

Fixing breaks for _Elasticsearch 7.x_ has been successfully included in _Vue Storefront 1.11_ upgrade. 

First thing you need to do is, download the upgrade with `git`. Upgraded version of containers are described in `docker-compose` files so what it contains inside is well encapsulated that you don't have to be concerned of how it works internally unless you want to tweak customization more than the default. 

Next, you should newly create each mapping for _Elasticsearch_ index as per the type. Then pumping your data into _Elasticsearch_ using _mage2vuestorefront_.  

If things go as planned so far so good, your above-7-Elasticsearch should serve as performant search engine for data store with enhanced indexing ability.  

### 4. Chef's secret (protip)

#### Secret 1. How to upgrade to `1.11` technically? foolproof approach.
There are 3 repositories that should be upgraded for `1.11`. 
:::warning CHECK
Please make sure your git space is clean and has nothing to conflict with upcoming merge. 
:::

First off, go to ___Vue Storefront API___ folder and type the following : 
```sh 
git fetch
git merge v1.11.0
```
:::tip NOTE
Please note `v1.11.0` is the _tag_ that denotes the final commit for the version at the moment.  
:::

Next, go to ___Vue Storefront___ folder and type the following : 
```sh
git fetch
git merge v1.11.0
```

Finally, go to ___mage2vuestorefront___ folder and run the following commands :
```sh
git fetch
git merge origin/feature/es7
```

Now you are all set :)

## 2. Extend Elasticsearch entities for VSF
Online shops normally have certain types of models and scenarios in common. (Because shops are shops in the end! What do you expect from shops? ;)) They are well known to the community and most of e-commerce software already implemented them into their frameworks as expected which is good for your new business. Those are represented as entities, namely, _Catalog_, _Products_, _Attributes_, _Tax rule_ and more. Since _Vue Storefront_ functions as the gorgeous gateway to those e-commerce backend, it also needs to mirror those entities as smooth as possible.  

 The large part of main entities are already implemented in VSF `core` as expected but you might still need to add or remove additional entities as you want it to fulfill your mission. This recipe will give you an idea of how to do it. 

### 1. Preparation
 - You need to have [setup _Vue Storefront_ stack](setup) including _Vue Storefront API_. 
 - There are two ways to deal with _Search Adapter_ for _Entity Type_ ; One is with _API_ (Recipe A), The other is with [_GraphQL_](https://graphql.org/) (Recipe B)
 - You should have custom entity module in Magento 2 to import custom entities. Download example module [here](https://github.com/kkdg/Offline_Stores)
 - You should have imported data for the new entity for the sake of testing. [2-0. Appetizer](#_2-0-appetizer) guides you in how to do it.
:::tip TIP
The default _Search Adapter_ is _API_. 

In order to change which _Search Adapter_ should be in labor, please take a look at here [Chef's secret 1. how to switch search adapters](#secret-1-how-to-switch-search-adapters)
:::

### 2-0 Appetizer
 0. Assume you need an entity type for _Offline Stores_ of your online shop for example. So you can store the information of your stores in data store, which is _Elasticsearch_ in this case, read the data whenever you need it like you want to display _offline stores_ while on checkout for customer to pick up if they live nearby.
:::tip NOTE
There are two ways to import your data into data store. One for using [`mage2vuestorefront`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront) which runs _NodeJS_ scripts to do the job while the other for using [`magento2-vsbridge-indexer`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) that is a native Magento 2 module for the job. 

In this recipe, we choose the former. But don't worry we will also look into the latter in the [Chef's secret 2](#secret-2-how-to-make-a-custom-import-using-magento2-vsbridge-indexer).
:::

 1. Go to ___mage2vuestorefront___ root folder and do the following : 
 ```bash
cd src/adapters/magento 
 ```
This folder is where the connector adapter should be. 

 2. Create the following file named, say, `offline_stores.js` as follows : 
 ```js
'use strict';

let AbstractMagentoAdapter = require('./abstract');
const CacheKeys = require('./cache_keys');
const util = require('util');

class OfflineStoresAdapter extends AbstractMagentoAdapter {

  getEntityType() {
    return 'offline_stores';
  }

  getName() {
    return 'adapters/magento/OfflineStoresAdapter';
  }

  getSourceData(context) {
    return this.api.offlineStores.list();
  }

  /**  Regarding Magento 2 api docs and reality we do have an exception here that items aren't listed straight in the response but under "items" key */
  prepareItems(items) {
    if(!items)
      return items;
 
    if (items.total_count)
      this.total_count = items.total_count;
    
    if(items.items)
      items = items.items; // this is an exceptional behavior for Magento 2 api  for attributes

    return items;
  }

  isFederated() {
    return false;
  }

  preProcessItem(item) {
    return new Promise((done, reject) => {
      if (item) {

      }

      return done(item);
    });
  }

  /**
   * We're transforming the data structure of item to be compliant with Smile.fr Elastic Search Suite
   * @param {object} item  document to be updated in elastic search
   */
  normalizeDocumentFormat(item) {
    return item;
  }
}

module.exports = OfflineStoresAdapter;

 ```

This is the basic skeleton for an adapter. We will look at this later. 

 3. Now, move on to `magento2-rest-client` library :
 ```bash
cd magento2-rest-client/lib
 ```

 4. Here we need to create a library file `offline_stores.js` for the adapter with the following :
 ```js
var util = require('util');

module.exports = function (restClient) {
    var module = {};

    module.list = function (searchCriteria) {
        var endpointUrl = util.format('/offline-stores');
        return restClient.get(endpointUrl);
    }

    return module;
}

 ````
This library file only deals with _GET_ API to get a list of offline stores from Magento 2.

:::tip NOTE
```js
var endpointUrl = util.format('/offline-stores');
```
 This line is particularly important, since `'/offline-stores'` is where the API url endpoint is determined. It should match the API url endpoint of Magento 2 side.
:::

 5. Now we need to include this library in `index.js` : 
 ```bash
cd ..
vi index.js
 ```

 Then fix it as follows : 

 ```js{5,16}
// ... abridged 

var blocks = require('./lib/blocks');
var pages = require('./lib/pages');
var offlineStores = require('./lib/offline_stores');

const MAGENTO_API_VERSION = 'V1';

module.exports.Magento2Client = function (options) {
    var instance = {};

    options.version = MAGENTO_API_VERSION;

    var client = RestClient(options);

    instance.offlineStores = offlineStores(client);
    instance.attributes = attributes(client);
    instance.categories = categories(client);

// abridged ...
 ```

 6. Time for creating a command to import the data, go to the folder where `cli.js` locates :  
 ```bash
cd ../../.. # ./src 
 ```

Open `cli.js` and add a method and a command as follows : 
 ```js{3-22}
 // ... abridged 

const reindexOfflineStores = (adapterName) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let adapter = factory.getAdapter(adapterName, 'offline_stores');
    adapter.run({
      done_callback: () => {
        logger.info('Task done! Exiting in 30s...');
        setTimeout(process.exit, TIME_TO_EXIT); // let ES commit all changes made
        resolve();
      }
    });
  });
}

program
  .command('offlinestores')
  .option('--adapter <adapter>', 'name of the adapter', 'magento')
  .option('--removeNonExistent <removeNonExistent>', 'remove non existent products', false)
  .action(async (cmd) => {
    await reindexOfflineStores(cmd.adapter, cmd.removeNonExistent);
  });

program
  .command('attributes')
  .option('--adapter <adapter>', 'name of the adapter', 'magento')
// abridged...
 ```

 7. All is good, now run the command to import offline stores information!
 ```bash
node cli.js offlinestores
 ```
 You will see a screen like below : 
 ```bash

```bash
export MAGENTO_URL=http://localhost/rest
```
Please replace the url if you use different one for the Magento 2 instance.

 8. Let's confirm the result and wrap this up! 
```bash
curl localhost:8080/api/catalog/vue_storefront_catalog/offline_stores/_search

          "tsk": 1583832150786
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
You have successfully imported your custom entities!


### 2-1. Recipe A (with API)

 1. First off, we need to create an `api` folder under `src/search/adapter/` as follows :
 ```bash
cd src/search/adapter
mkdir api 
 ```

 2. Copy `searchAdapter` file from `core` folder :
 ```bash
cp ../../../core/lib/search/adapter/api/searchAdapter.ts api/
 ```

:::tip NOTE
The reason you should copy the whole `searchAdapter.ts` file is, in doing so your adapter also includes default entities from `core` into custom file because your custom entities can't be added incrementally to the default. Here's [why](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/lib/search/adapter/searchAdapterFactory.js#L12-L20)
:::

 3. Write a function to handle adding a custom entity type in `searchAdapter.ts` you just copied and initialize it in the _constructor_ of the same class as follows : 
 ```js{9,14-24}
// ... abridged

export class SearchAdapter {
  public entities: any

  public constructor () {
    this.entities = []
    this.initBaseTypes()
    this.initCustomTypes()
  }

  //... abridged ...

  public initCustomTypes() {
    this.registerEntityType('offline_stores', {
      queryProcessor: (query) => {
        // function that can modify the query each time before it's being executed
        return query
      },
      resultProcessor: (resp, start, size) => {
        return this.handleResult(resp, 'offline_stores', start, size)
      }
    })
  }
}

 ```
Here you can see `registerEntityType` method add `offline_stores` entity type as an example. 

If you want to add more entities, you can clone the example as many times as you want and change entity name to your need.

:::tip TIP
The method `initCustomTypes` above is arbitrarily named out of the blue, so you can actually have any other name for the method. 
:::

Now you are all set to use custom entity you just created. The next step lets you have a simple idea how to confirm it. (optional)

 4. Go to `src/modules/instant-checkout/components` and open `InstantCheckout.vue`. Fix it as follows : 
 ```js{5,12-14}
// ... abridged 
import { currentStoreView } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/multistore'
import { registerModule } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/modules'
import { OrderModule } from '@vue-storefront/core/modules/order'
import { quickSearchByQuery } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/search'; // Import the method to fetch data from ES

const storeView = currentStoreView()

// ... abridged

  methods: {
    async showPayment () { // the method should be done with async/await
      let offlineStores = await quickSearchByQuery({ entityType: 'offline_stores' }); 
      alert("Your item will be sent from the shop at " + offlineStores.items[0].address); 
      const payment = new PaymentRequest(this.paymentMethods, this.paymentDetails , this.paymentOptions)

      // abridged ...
 ```

Now go to your online shop, put an item to cart and open it, click __Instant Checkout__ button, then you will see the screen like below : 

![instant_checkout_store_borderline](../images/stores.png)




### 3. Peep into the kitchen (what happens internally)
In this recipe, we iterated a whole journey of building custom entities on your online shop (it was Magento 2 for this time) for whatever reason to deal with various information for enhancing your customer experience.

First, we downloaded a Magento 2 module for _Offline Stores_ entity. It contains basic information for each offline store.

Second, as an appetizer, we had to import data from shop using _mage2vuestorefront_. We followed how core team did it with its sibling open source. 

Third, main dish, we extended core adapters in `src` folder so we are safe for future updates :).
 It was actually very easy! you just need to `registerEntityType` for your custom entity! We also looked at how to implement it in real example though it was simplified version, you better follow `vuex` best practice. 

We also have a variety of main dish, by giving you an option to go with _GraphQL_. This approach took us a little more to tweak with, but believe me, _GraphQL_ has [pretty good advantage](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/graphql-core-features-architecture-pros-and-cons/) over its competitors. 

Now we can extend our shop as good as it gets to handle more versatile information on your shop. Congratulation!


### 4. Chef's secret (protip)

#### Secret 1. How to switch _Search Adapters_ 
If you want to use _GraphQL_ adapter for your search, you need to change the value for `server.api` node to `graphql` in `./config/local.json` in _Vue Storefront_ as follows : 
```json{6}
{
  "server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3000,
    "protocol": "http",
    "api": "graphql",
    "devServiceWorker": false,
    "useHtmlMinifier": true,
    "htmlMinifierOptions": {
```
