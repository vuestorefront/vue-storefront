## 0. Introduction

Vue Storefront is getting tremendous attention from the market and gain traction from developers with more than 20 sites running on production. In the mean time, Vue Storefront framework evolves with each new release and the docs can hardly catch up with it! 

These training materials are a set of chief-recipes, experiences learned from the trenches. Iâ€™m trying to answer how to run Vue Storefront on production, troubleshoot most of the common problems and explain all the hidden features of Vue Storefront that can help you scale the application and solve most common issues.

Some topics here were taken from [frequently asked questions in our Forum](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/c/help). Some [came from Slack](http://slack.vuestorefront.io). Some came from core-consulting and our own works. One thing in common; each and every recipe is super-crucial for stable Vue Storefront run on production and they all cause some serious results when executed carelessly. 

## 1. Memory leaks
Vue Storefront consists of two Node.js applications:
- `vue-storefront` - which is the frontend app, with the entry point of [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/4ed26d7f1978a9e798edcddf1cf2f970c3e64e4f/core/scripts/server.js#L269)
- `vue-storefornt-api` - which is backend/api app.

If you're familiar with PHP web application and running PHP on production, be it fastCGI or FPM, _Node.js_ works totally different way. It's not executing `node` process per each request but rather running an internal http server which serves all the subsequent requests. It's single threaded, long running task. That's why it's fairly easy to get into memory leaks problems; especially with the `vue-storefront` app which is far more complex than the API.

### Protip

#### 1. First thing first, monitor memory leaks
How do you know you have memory leaks undercover? 

Start with `yarn pm2 status` or `yarn pm2 monit` for details from Vue Storefront root directory. 

The `pm2` [memory usage](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/monitoring/) is growing with each page refresh.

_PM2_ restarts the process after [1GB of RAM (by default)](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/ecosystem.json#L5) is in use; This can be adjusted and together with multiple node `instances` set in `ecosystem.json`, it's pretty good work-around for memory leaks.

Additionally, there are many ways to trace memory leaks, however we're using the browser tools (Memory profile) most of the time. [Here you have it explained in details](https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/04/03/how-to-track-and-fix-memory-leak-with-nodejs.html). Another useful tools are [New Relic APM](http://newrelic.com) and [Google Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup/nodejs)


#### 2. How to use Vue plugins

One thing you must avoid is using `Vue.use` multiple times and you can make it sure by calling it always inside `once`. In the Vue Storefront code you can pretty often find a snippet like this:

```js
import { once } from '@vue-storefront/core/helpers'
once('__VUE_EXTEND_RR__', () => {
  Vue.use(VueRouter)
})
```
This is a helper __helping__ you safely use plugins. Feel free to use it around with all your plugins and mixins instantiation. 

:::tip FURTHER STUDY
Vue.js docs has pretty good section on [how to avoid Vue.js memory leaks](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/avoiding-memory-leaks.html). 
:::

#### 3. Handling _Events_ in a proper way

Another thing is to properly handle the events. Each `EventBus.$on` must have its corresponding `EventBus.$off`. You should be carefully turn them on and off in its life cycle.

Secondly, please avoid the situation where **you bind the event in `created` hook**  whenever possible.
The `created` is called in the SSR mode or server side in plain English; But if you bind in `beforeMount` it will be executed only in the CSR (which stands for Client Side Rendering or simply client's browser) which is 99% desired behavior and you won't risk the memory leaks on events.

#### 4. Stateful Singleton

Make sure you have `runInNewContext` set to `true` (default value!) in [`core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L16).

With setting it `false`, the [Stateful Singletons](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/2664) like `RouteManager` or `i18n` we're using will cause the memory leaks at huuuuuge scale.


#### 5. Static pages generator

We do have **Static Pages Generator** - currently experimental feature - that can generate the whole site into a set of static HTML files so they could be served even directly from cloud provider/CDN - no memory leaks possible; what you need to take care of in this mode is cache invalidation (not currently supported but easy to add). [Read more on static page generator](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/pull/3256).

#### 6. Learn from core team
In case you want to dig deeper any concern related to memory leaks, [find out how core teams have dealt with memory leaks](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+memory+is%3Aclosed+leak) in Vue Storefront core - and check if any of those edge cases solved can be an inspiration for your project.


<br />
<br />

## 2. SSR Output cache
Vue Storefront supports [Server Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html). In this mode the same code which is executed in browser (CSR; Client Side Rendering), runs on the server in order to generate the HTML markup. The markup, then, gets transfered to the browser, rendered (extremly fast as the browsers have been all optimized to ... render html text in the last 20+ years) and [hydrated](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html) from the [initial state](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html#final-state-injection). During this whole procedure the client side or say browser scripts can use exactly the same code base universally. Another cool feature is that static HTML markup is well indexed by Search Engine crawlers which is extremely important for SEO.

Usually, Vue Storefront works pretty fast and all SSR requests are finished in between 100-300ms; However, if your database is huge or your server resources are low, or probably the traffic is extremely high you might want to enable the output cache. The other reason is that you might want to use SSR cache to prevent memory leaks or should I say, hide them ;).

### Protip

#### 1. SSR Cache docs

The SSR cache is [pretty well documented in our docs](/guide/basics/ssr-cache.html). What's important; It works for both: `vue-storefront` and `vue-storefront-api`.

[Read on all the caching mechanisms](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/caching-on-production-10b00a5614f8) that Vue Storefront is using.

#### 2. Using Redis tagging

With the SSR Output cache mode enabled, the [`core/server.js`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L187) stores the rendered output pages along with http headers into Redis cache. If the page exists in Redis, then it gets served without even starting the Vue SSR Renderer.

Vue Storefront uses Redis in order to use the [`redis-tagging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-tagging) library. Naming and caching are two most difficult areas of software development. Cache tagging helps us to deal with cache invalidation.

Vue Storefront tags the output pages with [product](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/helpers/search.ts#L69) and [category](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/store/category/actions.ts#L121) tags. Then all the indexers including: `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront` and `magento2-vsbridge-indexer` will invalidate the cache, by specific _product_ or _category_ _ID_. It means the [`invalidate`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L156) method will clear out the cache pages tagged with this specific _product id_. 

:::tip NOTE
 This URL requires you to pass the invalidation token set in the [config](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L12).
:::

You can add any number of the specific cache tags - by just extending the [`availableCacheTags`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L11) and/or [pushing the tags to `ssrContext`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/pages/Home.js#L19) so they can be used by `core/scripts/server`.

This `context` argument passed to `asyncData()` is actually the same context object used by [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L168), so we're using it as transfer object for passing the tags back and forth between server and Vue.js application.

#### 3. Invalidating SSR cache

:::tip NOTE
With the SSR cache enabled (in the `vue-storefront-api` or `vue-storefront` app) please make sure, you're not using the cache on different layer (for example Varnish or nginx). Otherwise the cache invalidation mechanism won't work. 
:::

The dynamic tags config option: `useOutputCacheTagging` - if set to `true`, Vue Storefront generates the special HTTP Header `X-VS-Cache-Tags`

```js
res.setHeader('X-VS-Cache-Tags', cacheTags);
```

Cache tags are assigned regarding the products and categories that are used on the specific page. A typical `X-VS-Cache-Tags` tag looks like this:

```
X-VS-Cache-Tags: P1852 P198 C20
```

The tags can be used to invalidate the Varnish cache if you use it. [Read more on that](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/cache-api/cache-tags-varnish).

:::tip NOTE
 All the official Vue Storefront data indexers including [magento1-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/divanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer) and [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) support the cache invalidation. 

 If the cache is enabled in both API and Vue Storefront frontend app, please make sure you properly use the `config.server.invalidateCacheForwardUrl` config variable as the indexers can send the cache invalidate request only to one URL (either frontend or backend) and it **should be forwarded** to the other. Please check the default forwarding URLs in the `default.json` and adjust the `key` parameter to the value of `server.invalidateCacheKey`.

## 3. Avoiding prices desynchronization 

Vue Storefront indexers (`magento2-vsbridge-indexer`, `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront`) all store the product price (before/after catalog rules applied) into the Elasticsearch. But Elasticsearch can be easily out of sync or the synchronization can be lagged. To avoid the risk of displaying an incorrect price to the customers, Vue Storefront has at least 3 mechanisms - with the `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` on the top.

:::tip NOTE
If you're using the `mage2vuestorefront` for syncing the products please make sure you're syncing the prices **after catalog rules** applied. For this purpose we have special flags to be set on:

```bash
export PRODUCTS_SPECIAL_PRICES=true
export PRODUCTS_RENDER_PRICES=true
node --harmony cli.js products --removeNonExistent=true --partitions=1
```
:::

### Protip

#### 1. _alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver_ to be in sync

When the `config.products.alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` option is on, Vue Storefront will update the visible price on all the listings and product detail pages **directly from source web store, say, Magento**. (Magento represents source web store hereunder) The code in charge for this operation is located in the [`doPlatformPricesSync`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L212) helper which is called from the [`tax/calculateTaxes`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/tax/actions.ts#L74) action.

:::tip NOTE
This mode works whenever the price is calculated in either server or client's side (`config.tax.calculateServerSide` option).
:::

Check if the way [Vue Storefront syncs the price](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L216) is exactly what you need, and not [override this action](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/cookbook/module.html#_2-2-recipe-b-override-vuex-store-with-extendstore).


#### 2. _alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver_ has 2 options 

The `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` mode has two additional options:

1. Clear the price before sync: `config.products.clearPricesBeforePlatformSync` - when set to `true`, users won't see the price cached in Elasticsearch before getting the new price from Magento
2. Synchronous mode - `config.products.waitForPlatformSync` -  by default the price sync runs in parallel to displaying the product or category content, that is, _asynchronous_. We can make it synchronous (waiting for this process to finish) in order to have just the current price from Magento rendered in the HTML markup (SSR; otherwise the price in SSR will be from Elasticsearch).

More than that - Vue Storefront always gets the **platform totals** (the final price visible in the shopping cart and the order summary) from Magento or any other backend. There is then no risk your customers see the product with incorrect price.


<br />
<br />

## 4. Avoiding stock desynchronization

Pretty much the same case as with the price can occur with the product stocks. By default, all the indexers set the [stock information right into the product object](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-integration-sdk/blob/tutorial/Format-product.md) as follows :

 - In the main structure of `product.stock`
 - In `product.configurable_children.stock` for `configurable_children`.

 This information can be outdated.

### Protip

#### 1. How it stays in sync in real time

 Vue Storefront **by default** checks the current stock information when:

 - [**user adds product to the cart**](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/itemActions.ts#L53) - this is an asynchronous process (similar one is run when browsing the product variants - you can get info like `0 items available` when switching colors and sizes); `Checkout.js` is waiting for all the results from the [`stock/queueCheck`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/pages/Checkout.js#L69) calls.
 - when the **cart is synced** with the server - eCommerce backend [checks the product availability once again](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/mergeActions.ts#L45) and [notify user](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/components/AddToCart.ts#L31) if the product can't be added to the cart or restores previous quantity (if changed).
 - when the `filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is on and the user a) enters the product page, b) browses the category pages.

 The `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is pretty important thing because only by having this mode switched on you can be sure we're **not displaying unavailable variants**. When it's set to `true` Vue Storefront takes the stock information out of Magento and updates the `product.stock` info for the whole product list + product page (current product). Then it removes all the `configurable_children` that are not avaialable. [See the detailed implementation](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L121).


#### 2. Additional options

There are two additional settings for this mode on:
 - `config.products.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStatic` - when this is `true`, Vue Storefront prefetches the stock info for the statically set number of product, it can be configured by `config.products.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStaticPrefetchCount`.
 - `config.products.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchDynamic` - when this is set to true, Vue Storefront prefetches the stock info for any visible product; it's done in the [`ProductTile.vue`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/src/themes/default/components/core/ProductTile.vue#L108) - Make sure your theme supports this.
    
We've got the limited support for Magento MSI in the default implementation. [Make sure you've got it enabled when on Magento 2.3.x](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/pull/226).

:::tip NOTE
This feature might then be used for the **Donut caching** strategies related to [Tip 2 - SSR cache](#_2-ssr-output-cache).
:::

:::tip NOTE
 If you want to bypass Magento stock calls there is a way by getting the data with the same format as `https://vue-storefront-api/api/stock/list` that returns it but from Elasticsearch. It should be a drop-in replacement - I mean [changing the `stock.endpoint`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bb9044d6aaa36d4881733876f4646fabe7b6e102/config/default.json#L368) to this new one. Et voila: you skip asking Magento, still having this 'cache hole punching' with `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode on
:::

There is a ready-made endpoint for getting stock from Elasticsearch (not from Magento) is [here #PR330](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/pull/330).

:::warning TROUBLESHOOTING 
If the non-existing variants won't disappear that means some frontend work on your side needs to be done. 
:::
I mean - with this `filterOutUnavailableVariants` setting, we're pulling the current stock info to `product.stock` and `product.configurable_children.stock` properties. As those properties updated we're then removing the out-of-stock `configurable_children`.
If the variants are still available then [take a look at this line](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts#L629) and there should be a change made like

from:

```js
if (isServer) {
  subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
  subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
} else {
  attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
  context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }) // exec async
}
```
to:

```js
  subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
if (isServer) {
  subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
} else {
  attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
}
```

Just to make sure that attribute filtering always takes place before rendering the PDP (Product Detail Page).

<br />
<br />

## 5. How Vue Storefront calculates prices and taxes


### Protip

#### 1. Two modes for tax calculation 

Vue Storefront has two modes of calculating the product price :
- Client side (when `config.tax.calculateServerSide` is set to `false`) - that can be useful in case the tax should be recalculated based on the address change.
- Server side (when `config.tax.calculateServerSide` is set to `true`) - which is default.

Depending on the mode, taxes are calulated by [`taxCalc.ts` client side](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L74) or [`taxcalc.js` server side](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/d3d0e7892cd063bbd69e545f3f2b6fdd9843d524/src/lib/taxcalc.js#L251-L253). 

You may see that both these files apply **exactly** the same logic.

#### 2. Factors considered for tax rate

In order to calculate the prices and taxes we need first to get the proper tax rate. It's based on [`taxrate`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-integration-sdk#taxrate-entity) entity, stored in the Elasticsearch. Each product can have the property [`product.tax_class_id`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L213) set. Depending on its value, Vue Storefront applies the `taxrate` and the [country and region to the filter](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L226). 

:::tip NOTE
 We're currently not supporting searching the tax rules by neither `customer_tax_class_id` nor the `tax_postcode` fields of `taxrate` entity. Pull Requests are more than welcome ;)
:::

#### 3. Calculation

After getting the right tax rate we can calculate the prices.

We've got the following price fields priority in the VSF:

- `final_price` - if set, depending on the `config.tax.finalPriceIncludesTax` - it's taken as final price or Net final price,
- `special_price` - if it's set and lower than `price` it will replace the `price` and the `price` value will be set into `original_price` property,
- `price` - if set, depending on the `config.tax.sourcePriceIncludesTax` - it's taken as final price or Net final price.

Depending on the `config.tax.finalPriceIncludesTax` and `config.tax.sourcePriceIncludesTax` settings, Vue Storefront calculates the price and stores them into following fields.

Product Special price:
- `special_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `special_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `special_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount.

Product Regular price:
- `price` - required, if set - it's always Net price,
- `price_incl_tax` - required, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `price_tax` - required, if set it's the tax amount,

Product Final price:
- `final_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `final_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `final_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount,

Product Original price (set only if `final_price` or `special_price` are lower than `price`):
- `original_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `original_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `original_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount.

:::tip NOTE
 The prices are set for all `configurable_children` with the exact same format
:::

:::tip NOTE
If any of the `configurable_children` has the price lower than the main product, the main product price will be updated accordingly.

## 6. Limiting SSR HTML size a.k.a. INITIAL_STATE optimization

One of the key side-effects of the [Server Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) is the need to provide the initial Vuex state right to the browser just before the page is hydrated. 

Hydration means - Vue.js populates the statically generated HTML markups with virtually generated (CSR) Vue.js component tree. **Only after this process, site becomes interactive**. Even slightly different markup might cause SSR hydration errors. Therefore, Vue.js requires us to [output the `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/client-entry.ts#L29) which is then used to **replace** the Vuex initial state. Then, the [app gets hydrated](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/client-entry.ts#L111) by `app.mount()` call.

The only problem is, that the `__INITIAL_STATE__` can be really huuuuuuuge. On category pages, including a lot of product listings it can be in megabytes!
Vue Storefront provides you with a few mechanisms to control the initial state.

### Protip

#### 1. Filter `__INITIAL_STATE__`
1. Vue Storefront provides you a mechanism to control the `__INITIAL_STATE__` [based on the `config.ssr.initialStateFilter`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L40) fields list. So you can remove the fields from `__INITIAL_STATE__` - even using the `.` notation. So you can put `attribute` on the list to remove the whole state for `attribute` Vuex module OR you can specify `attribute.list_by_code` to remove just that. By using this mechanism, you can process much more data in the SSR than are sent to the browser (see point no. 2 which is just about opposite approach to limit the set of processed information).

2. You might also want to use the [`config.entities.*.includeFields`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/config/default.json#L170) filter. These lists of fields are set to limit the number of fields [loaded from Elasticsearch](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/lib/search.ts#L31). If you add any new field to your entity though, please make sure you also include it in the `includeFields` list.

:::warning CAUTION
With these mechanisms, you must be fully aware of the **hydration damage** they might cause. In order to prevent any hydration issues, you might use [`lazy-hydrate`](https://github.com/maoberlehner/vue-lazy-hydration) that will let you control the hydration flow for specific parts (components) on the page. Especially the [manual hydration](https://github.com/maoberlehner/vue-lazy-hydration#manually-trigger-hydration) can be useful.
:::

The general rule of thumb is that **when you remove anything from the intial state** then you should:
- load this data ASAP in the client side (eg. in `beforeMount`).
- hydrate the component **only after** the data was loaded.

### 2. Best practice for hydration from core team

See how we did it for [`Category.vue`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/ab27bfbd8abef5f1d37666a38fa0387f50ba6eca/src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue#L70) - where the hydration is manually triggered by the [`loading`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/ab27bfbd8abef5f1d37666a38fa0387f50ba6eca/src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue#L70) flag.

:::tip TIP
 Please make sure if you're loading your category tree dynamically - as the category trees can be truly heavy with all these subcategories included. By default Vue Storefront offers this [dynamic category prefetching from v1.7](/guide/basics/configuration.html#dynamic-categories-prefetching).
:::

You can save up to 30-40% of the page size which positively improve the Lighthouse/Pagespeed scores. However not always improves the User Experience - as the lazy hydration typically requires you to fetch the required data by another network call (which can be skipped by the initial state mechanism).

Of course, in the end please make sure that you compress (gzip + minify) the SSR output - probably on [nginx level](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-increase-pagespeed-score-by-changing-your-nginx-configuration-on-ubuntu-16-04) or using the [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) and/or [minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-minify) middleware added to the [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/scripts/server.js#L116)

## 7. Url Dispatcher explained 

Starting with Vue Storefront 1.9 we support [custom url structure](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/url.html). `UrlDispatcher` is enabled by default in the [`config.seo.useUrlDispatcher`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/config/default.json#L29). 

The business logic of the dispatcher has been implemented as a [Vue router guard](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html) - [`beforeEach`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/router/beforeEach.ts#L41).

The dispatcher first runs the [`url/mapUrl`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L42). This action first checks the `state.dispatcherMap` for the previously registered URL mapping. If no mapping is set then dispatcher checks the [`localStorage` cache](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L51) and only after that the `mappingFallback` action is called.

It's the place where the true mapping takes place. By default, Vue Storefront first checks the URL against Elasticsearch, `product` entities - using the `url_path` as a filter. If it's not found (statistically products are 10x more frequently browsed by URL than categories because of their count), then the request to `category` collection is made.

Once the route was mapped it's [registered](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L56) in the `dispatcherMap` in order to not execute the additional network request in the future.

The optimization hack is that [`category-next/loadCategoryProducts`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/catalog-next/store/category/actions.ts#L100) already registers the mapping - so clicking the product from the category list doesn't require any network call to get the proper route data.

As you've might seen the `url/mapUrl` returns the data in a very similar format to routes collection used by vue-router. **It's not the real route though**. It's converted to `Route` object by the `processDynamicRoute` helper before being processed by the router itself. To avoid any user redirections we're using the `RouterManager` to [add this route to the `vue-router` routing table](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/router/beforeEach.ts#L43) and forward the user to this new, exact match route in order to render the proper page.

This mechanism is pretty flexible as you may add the dynamic routes on the fly. There is even a [community module](https://github.com/kodbruket/vsf-mapping-fallback) letting you map the url routes programmatically.

:::tip NOTE
 The [`processDynamicRoute`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/helpers/index.ts#L26) does convert the `routeData` from `url/mapUrl` to **real** vue `Route` object. It works like it's searching through all the routes registered by `theme` and `modules`. Example:
:::

If your route data is (`routeData`):

```js
{
  name: 'configurable-product',
  params: {
    slug: product.slug,
    parentSku: product.sku,
    childSku: params['childSku'] ? params['childSku'] : product.sku
}
```

and your `theme/router/index.js` consists of the following definition: (`userRoute`)

```js
  { name: 'configurable-product', path: '/p/:parentSku/:slug/:childSku', component: Product }
```

then `processDynamicRoute` helper will return the `Route` object created by merging the `userRoute` with `routeData`

```js
  Object.assign({}, userRoute, routeData, { path: '/' + fullRootPath, name: `urldispatcher-${fullRootPath}` })
```

`fullRootPath` is the url processed by the dispatcher. This new, virtual route is added to the vue-router routing table and the user is forwarded to it. So you may see that `url` module can be switched on/off easily as it uses the on-top mechanism over the existing vue-router - mapping the virtual urls to existing theme or module routes.

:::tip NOTE
 In order to have it up and running please make sure your `products` and `categories` do have the `url_path` properly set and unique.

## 8. Multistore configuration explained

You can read about the [basic Multistore configuration in the official docs](/guide/integrations/multistore.html#changing-the-ui-for-specific-store-views). Vue Storefront supports multistore based on the `StoreView` level. 

`StoreView` is a configuration context object, set by the Vue Storefront per each request - accessible via [`currentStoreView()`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L33) helper from [`multistore.ts`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/lib/multistore.ts).

One `StoreView` generally means a combination of Language + Currency.

:::tip EXAMPLE
If you have a store per country, that supports two languages (e.g. Switzerland supporting EURO currency and both French + German languages) you'll probably end up with a pair of two `StoreViews`: (EUR; DE) + (EUR; FR). Each `StoreView` has its own unique name that is used to differentiate and switch the sites.
:::

Vue Storefront `StoreViews` allows you to differentiate all the basic settings per specific site. [See the config](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/config/default.json#L91):

```json
 "storeViews": {
      "multistore": false,
      "commonCache": true,
      "mapStoreUrlsFor": ["de", "it"],
      "de": {
        "storeCode": "de",
        "disabled": true,
        "storeId": 3,
        "name": "German Store",

          "host": "/api/catalog",
          "index": "vue_storefront_catalog_de"
        },
        "tax": {
          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,
          "defaultCountry": "DE",
          "defaultRegion": "",
          "calculateServerSide": true
        },

          "currencySign": "EUR",
          "dateFormat": "HH:mm D-M-YYYY"
        }
      },
      "it": {
        "storeCode": "it",
        "disabled": true,

          "index": "vue_storefront_catalog_it"
        },
        "tax": {
          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,
          "defaultCountry": "IT",
          "defaultRegion": "",

        },
        "i18n": {
          "fullCountryName": "Italy",
          "fullLanguageName": "Italian",
          "defaultCountry": "IT",
          "defaultLanguage": "IT",
          "defaultLocale": "it-IT",
          "currencyCode": "EUR",
          "currencySign": "EUR",
          "dateFormat": "HH:mm D-M-YYYY"
        }
      }
    }
  ```
### Protip

#### 1. Create the individual indexes per each specific `StoreView`

First of all - we have a separate Elasticsearch config per each storeView. This means you can have `product`, `categories` and `attributes` text attributes translated and stored - each in the separate Elasticsearch indices.

Our [default indexer](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront#multistore-setup) and the [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) both support the multistore indexing.

#### 2. Setup the `storeViews` section in the `config/local.json` 

Each _storeView_ must have the unique `code` (`it` and `de` in the example above) set + elasticsearch section pointing to the corresponding index.

:::tip NOTE
Remember to populate the same configuration [within the `vue-storefront-api` config file](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/config/default.json#L50). Please make sure that the `config.availableStores` collection contains all the `storeCodes` you'll be passing to the API as well.
:::

:::tip NOTE
The multistore business logic is applied only when the `config.storeViews.multistore` is set to `true` (the default value is: `false`).
:::

The `storeCode` parameter [will be appended as a query parameter (`?storeCode`)](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L105) to all `vue-storefront-api` requests that will let API know which backend API endpoints to query. By default - with Magento 2 [we're adding the proper `storeCode` to the API request calls](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/src/platform/magento2/util.js#L7). However you can even [differentiate the base url or Magento 2 API credentials if you like](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/src/platform/magento2/util.js#L20). 

#### 3. Vue Storefront `storeCode` resolver

Vue Storefront sets `currentStoreView` value as one of the first things processing the request. It's done in the [`app.ts:createStore`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/app.ts#L73) function. The `storeCode` is retrived from the [server context](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/server-entry.ts#L63) or [from the current route](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/server-entry.ts#L67).

The [`storeCodeFromRoute`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/lib/storeCodeFromRoute.ts) helper supports two ways of obtaining the current store code:

1) from the url path: https://test.storefrontcloud.io/de vs. https://test.storefrontcloud.io/it
2) from the [url domain name and path](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/storeCodeFromRoute.ts#L30); this way lets you run Vue Storefront multistore on multiple domains.

:::tip NOTE
 You can pass the `storeCode` via server context as well. Server context is set by the [`core/scripts/server.ts`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L110) - and it's sourced from `ENV.STORE_CODE` or if you're using a HTTP Proxy (like nginx) - from the request header of `x-vs-store-code`. This way you can differentiate store view instances by many different ways and not only by the domain/url.
:::

#### 4. Routing

Vue Storefront adds all the routes to the routing table using [current `storeView` code prefix](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/src/themes/default/index.js#L31). If your [theme/router/index.js](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/themes/default/router/index.js) has the following routes defined, and the `currentStoreVioew().storeCode === 'de'`

```js
 let routes = [
  { name: 'checkout', path: '/checkout', component: Checkout },
  { name: 'legal', path: '/legal', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Legal Notice'}, meta: {title: 'Legal Notice', description: 'Legal Notice - example of description usage'} },
  { name: 'privacy', path: '/privacy', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Privacy'} },
```

Then the [`setupMultistoreRoutes`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L172) helper will add these routes to `vue-router` as:

```js
 let routes = [
  { name: 'checkout', path: '/de/checkout', component: Checkout },
  { name: 'legal', path: '/de/legal', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Legal Notice'}, meta: {title: 'Legal Notice', description: 'Legal Notice - example of description usage'} },
  { name: 'privacy', path: '/de/privacy', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Privacy'} },
```

The business logic of modifying the route configs is embeded in the [`localizedRouteConfig`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L189) helper.

:::tip NOTE
 When you're using the `storeCode` resolver, based on `domain + path` schema then you should set the `config.storeViews.*.appendStoreCode` to `false`. This option prevents `localizedRouteConfig` helper from adding the `storeCode` as a path so the store views can be differentiated based on the `currentStoreView().url` instead - which supports `domain + path`.
:::

:::tip NOTE 
Please make sure you're creating the links within your theme using the same `localizedRoute` helper. This helper supports string URLs:
```html
<router-link :to="localizedRoute(page.link)" class="cl-accent relative">{{
  page.title
}}</router-link>
```
or route objects:
```html
<router-link
  :to="
    localizedRoute({
      name: product.type_id + '-product',
      params: {
        parentSku: product.parentSku ? product.parentSku : product.sku,
        slug: product.slug,
        childSku: product.sku,
      },
    })
  "
></router-link>
```
:::

:::tip NOTE
The `UrlDispatcher` feature - available from Vue Storefront 1.9 supports the multistore routes as well. The `url_path` field passed to [`url/mapUrl`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L46) action takes the full url - including `storeCode` as an entry parameter. You might want to use [vsf-mapping-fallback](https://github.com/kodbruket/vsf-mapping-fallback) for some overrides.
:::

#### 5. Customizing the theme per store view

You can run all the `StoreViews` within one, single Vue Storefront instance. It's the default mode. The `StoreViews` are then selected based on the url/path/incoming request headers or `env` variables. As simple as it can get, this mode won't let you apply totally different themes for each individual `StoreView`. It's because the theme files are bundled within `app.js` bundle provided to the client. Having all themes bundled in will generate a really huge JS bundle and slow down the page in the end.

You can still customize some UI elements per `storeView` using conditional `v-if` logic and loading specific components within single theme.
 
:::tip NOTE
You can also override some root-level components (like `pages/Category.vue`) by modifying the `theme/router/index.js` routing schema by adding the specific store-view based urls directly in the routing table.
:::

If you really need to use different themes per each individual `storeView`, then the best way would be to deploy and execute separate Vue Storefront node instances per each store view (e.g. `de` running on port 3000, `it` on 3001 etc); Then make sure your proxy service routes the request to the proper instance. The instances can have different configs, including different `config.theme` parameter.

Your `nginx` config for this scheme will be something like this:

``` 
ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/

ProxyPass /de http://localhost:3001/de
ProxyPassReverse /de http://localhost:3001/de

ProxyPass /it http://localhost:3002/it
ProxyPassReverse /it http://localhost:3002/it
```

<br />
<br />

## 9. HTML minimization, compression, headers

The HTML generated by Vue Storefront can be pretty ... well long :) We put a lot of CSS and JS in this single file. More than that there is the whole Vuex state included in the `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` dump in order to support the Client Side data hydration.

To minimize the time the browser will need to download the initial SSR-rendered HTML, there are a few tricks to be implemented.

### Protip

#### 1. Compression

You might want to enable the `gzip/deflate` or `brotli` compression in the first-line HTTP Server of your choice: `nginx`, `varnish` or `apache`. The good news is that Vue Storefront supports the `gzip` compression as well using the [`compression` Express.js middleware](https://github.com/expressjs/compression). It's enabled by default [in the production mode](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/modules/compress/server.ts).

#### 2. HTML Minimization

The second option is to minimize the HTML, CSS and JS by just removing the white characters. This option is by default on - by the [`config.server.useHtmlMinifier`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/5f1e36d611c983de252ce08dea78726b6e10044d/config/default.json#L8) switch. We use the [html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) npm package in order to get the work done here. You might want to adjust the [`html-minifier` configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier#options-quick-reference) by tweaking the `config.server.htmlMinifierOptions` property.


#### 3. Headers

You can set various set of different HTTP headers in order to tweak the edge-caching strategies with your CDN/proxy. You can set the output headers in the `asyncData` of any root-level component.

```js
<script>
export default {
  name: 'RawOutputExample',
  asyncData ({ store, route, context }) {
    context.server.response.setHeader('ETag', 'custom-value')
    context.server.response.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'max-age=533280')
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      resolve()
    })
  },
  components: {
  }
}
</script>
```

<br />
<br />

## 10. Production catalog indexing + cache invalidation

Although many Vue Storefornt projects are being developed using [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront/tree/master/src) indexer - it's definitely not a production ready solution. Mostly because of the performance and it doesn't fully support on-demand indexing (indexing only the changes of products and categories, in real time).

Because of this limitation we created a set of [native indexers](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/native-magento-data-indexer-aec3c9ebfb).

The indexers are available for:
- [Magento 1](https://github.com/divanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer)
- [Magento 2](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2-vsbridge-indexer)

The native indexer updates the Elasticsearch index in the very same format as the `mage2vuestorefront`. Our intention was to speed up the indexation process and make it more reliable. With native indexer, we were able to use the Magento 2 ORM and events to optimize the indexation process. Please do use this module instead of `mage2vuestorefront` if you experience any issue regarding indexing performance. Both projects are currently officially supported by the Vue Storefront Core team.

When the SSR caching is enabled (see [Tip 2](#_2-ssr-output-cache)), you need to make sure the indexers are properly configured to refresh exactly the pages that changed.

We tag the output pages with [product](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/helpers/search.ts#L69) and [category](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/store/category/actions.ts#L121) tags. Then all the indexers including: `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront`, `magento2-vsbridge-indexer` will invalidate the cache, by specific product or category ID. It means, the [`invalidate`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L156) method will clear out the cache pages tagged with this specific product ID. 
:::tip NOTE
This URL requires you to pass the invalidation token set in the [config](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L12).
:::

The tags can be used to invalidate the Varnish cache, if you're using it. [Read more on that](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/cache-api/cache-tags-varnish).

:::tip NOTE
All the official Vue Storefront data indexers including [magento1-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/divanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer), [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) support the cache invalidation. If the cache is enabled in both API and Vue Storefront frontend app, please make sure you are properly using the `config.server.invalidateCacheForwardUrl` config variable as the indexers can send the cache invalidate request only to one URL (either frontend or backend) and it **should be forwarded** to the other. Please check the default forwarding URLs in the `default.json` and adjust the `key` parameter to the value of `server.invalidateCacheKey`.
:::

## 11. Using Magento Checkout

Vue Storefront Checkout is fully ready to be deployed on production. The thing is, however, in order to complete, you need to **integrate Vue Storefront with payment providers**. Unfortunately some popular Vue Storefront payment modules ([Stripe](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/t/stripe-payment-integration/155), [Paypal](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/t/paypal-payment-integration/152)) are not supporting the **status notification** changes. This is mostly because the payment modules are **platform agnostic** as well. The status notification changes must be implemented on your own, depending on the platform.

Having that said - one of the other viable options for the Checkout integration is [**Magento Checkout Fallback**](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/t/external-checkout/150) module, maintained by [Vendic](http://vendic.nl). 

When using this module, please make sure you've successfully dispatched the `cart/sync` (VSF 1.11), `cart/serverPull` (VSF 1.10) action and the sync process has finished. Otherwise there could be a situation when the sync hasn't been fully executed and user getting to the Magento checkout sees some discrepancies between Magento and Vue Storefront carts. For example - product added to the VSF cart hasn't been yet added to Magento cart.

To avoid this situation you should modify the [beforeEach](https://github.com/Vendic/vsf-external-checkout/blob/baeefd179038b2bd9b4a1a00c95b82b131b61b65/router/beforeEach.ts#L14):


```js
export function beforeEach(to: Route, from: Route, next) {
  const cartToken: string = rootStore.state.cart.cartServerToken;
  const userToken: string = rootStore.state.user.token;
  const externalCheckoutConfig = {...config.externalCheckout};
  const cmsUrl: string = externalCheckoutConfig.cmsUrl;
  const stores = externalCheckoutConfig.stores;
  const storeCode = currentStoreView().storeCode
  const multistoreEnabled: boolean = config.storeViews.multistore

  if (multistoreEnabled) {
    await rootStore.dispatch('cart/sync')
    if (storeCode in stores && to.name === storeCode + '-checkout') {
      window.location.replace(stores[storeCode].cmsUrl + '/vue/cart/sync/token/' + userToken + '/cart/' + cartToken)
    } else if (storeCode in stores && to.name === 'checkout' && stores[storeCode].cmsUrl !== undefined) {
      window.location.replace(stores[storeCode].cmsUrl + '/vue/cart/sync/token/' + userToken + '/cart/' + cartToken)
    } else {
      next()
    }
  } else {
    if (to.name === 'checkout') {
      window.location.replace(cmsUrl + '/vue/cart/sync/token/' + userToken + '/cart/' + cartToken)
    } else {
      next()
    }
  }
}

## 12. Elasticsearch production setup

Elasticsearch is a viable part of the [`vue-storefront-api`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api) middleware data source. The included Docker files are supposed to be used in the development mode and they're not ready for production.

Elasticsearch should be run on cluster mode with minimum 3 nodes and having sufficient memory limits (usually it's around 8GB per node minimum). Otherwise Elasticsearch service won't provide the required High Availability level.

Being Elasticsearch is a Java service, the critical setting is Java Heap size limits - that needs to be set to the limit as high as required to provide Elasticsearch with sufficient memory for the search operations and as low as required for the other parts of OS/services to keep running. To not overrun the container memory limits.

By default, Elasticsearch tells the JVM to use a heap with a minimum and maximum size of 1 GB. When moving to production, it is important to configure heap size to ensure that Elasticsearch has enough heap available.

Quote from the [ElasticSearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/heap-size.html)

The value for these settings depends on the amount of RAM available on your server:

- Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than 50% of your physical RAM. Elasticsearch requires memory for purposes other than the JVM heap and it is important to leave space for this. For instance, Elasticsearch uses off-heap buffers for efficient network communication, relies on the operating systemâ€™s filesystem cache for efficient access to files, and the JVM itself requires some memory too. It is normal to observe the Elasticsearch process using more memory than the limit configured with the `Xmx` setting.
Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than the threshold that the JVM uses for compressed object pointers (compressed oops); the exact threshold varies but is near 32 GB. You can verify that you are under the threshold by looking for a line in the logs like the following:

- heap size `1.9gb`, compressed ordinary object pointers `true`
Ideally set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than the threshold for zero-based compressed oops; the exact threshold varies but 26 GB is safe on most systems, but can be as large as 30 GB on some systems. You can verify that you are under this threshold by starting Elasticsearch with the JVM options `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:`+PrintCompressedOopsMode and looking for a line like the following:

```log
heap address: 0x000000011be00000, size: 27648 MB, zero based Compressed Oops
showing that zero-based compressed oops are enabled. If zero-based compressed oops are not enabled then you will see a line like the following instead:

heap address: 0x0000000118400000, size: 28672 MB, Compressed Oops with base: 0x00000001183ff000
```

## 13. .htaccess, server side redirects, HTTP codes and headers, middlewares

We strongly recommend using kind of HTTP server as a proxy in front of Vue Storefront. Let it be `nginx` (suggested in our [production setup docs](/guide/installation/production-setup.html)) or `Varnish` or even `Apache`. Any of those HTTP servers allows you to add some authorization or redirects layer before Vue Storefront.

This is a recommended way.

### Protip

#### 1. Advanced Output Processing

However, by using [advanced output processing](/guide/core-themes/layouts.html#how-it-works) you can easily generate any text data output from your Vue Storefront site you want. Including JSON, XML and others. It's a way to generate sitemaps and other data based documents.

#### 2. `Express.js` middleware

The other option is to create a `Express.js` middleware. Our `core/scripts/server.ts` is a classical Node.js application so it should be easy. To do so you might want to create a [server module](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/modules/compress/server.ts).

Server modules are located in `src/modules` and always have the `server.ts` entry point which responds to one of the few server entry points:

- `afterProcessStarted` - executed just [after the server started](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/2c6e0e1c8e73952beabf550fe4530344a6bcce15/core/scripts/server.ts#L13).
- `afterApplicationInitialized` - executed just [after Express app got initialized](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/2c6e0e1c8e73952beabf550fe4530344a6bcce15/core/scripts/server.ts#L34). It's a good entry point to bind new request handlers (`app.get(...)`, `app.use(...)`). Read more on [Express.js request handlers and routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).
- `beforeOutputRenderedResponse` - executed [after the SSR rendering has been done](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/2c6e0e1c8e73952beabf550fe4530344a6bcce15/core/scripts/server.ts#L189) but before sending it out to the browser; It lets you override the rendered SSR content with your own.
- `afterOutputRenderedResponse` - executed [after advanced output processing pipeline](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/2c6e0e1c8e73952beabf550fe4530344a6bcce15/core/scripts/server.ts#L212) executed.
- `beforeCacheInvalidated`, `afterCacheInvalidated` - executed [before and after cache has been invalidated](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/2c6e0e1c8e73952beabf550fe4530344a6bcce15/core/scripts/server.ts#L76)

Here is an [example how to bind](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/modules/google-cloud-trace/server.ts) tracing module just after server process started:

```js
import { serverHooks } from '@vue-storefront/core/server/hooks'

serverHooks.afterProcessStarted((config) => {
  let trace = require('@google-cloud/trace-agent')
  if (config.has('trace') && config.get('trace.enabled')) {
    trace.start(config.get('trace.config'))
  }
})
```

[Another example](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/modules/compress/server.ts) - pretty common case - binding new Express middleware to process all user requests BEFORE they're processed by SSR rendering pipeline (including custom URL addresses):

```js
import { serverHooks } from '@vue-storefront/core/server/hooks'

const compression = require('compression')
serverHooks.afterApplicationInitialized(({ app, isProd }) => {
  if (isProd) {
    console.log('Output Compression is enabled')
    app.use(compression({ enabled: isProd }))
  }
})
```

If you'd like to bind custom URL address this example can be modified like this:

```js
import { serverHooks } from '@vue-storefront/core/server/hooks'

serverHooks.afterApplicationInitialized(({ app, isProd }) => {
  app.get('/custom-url-address', (req, res) => {
    res.end('Custom response')
  })
})
```

## 14. Which fields of product, category and attribute are really used by VSF


The data formats used by Vue Storefront for products and categories are quite sophisticated with a whole range of optional fields. To get a better understanding which fields are truly required and how they work - please look at the [storefront-api](https://github.com/vuestorefront/storefront-api/) documentation:

- [GraphQL schema](https://divanteltd.github.io/storefront-graphql-api-schema/) which describes the Product and Category entity with the subsequent types.
- [Product entity](https://sfa-docs.now.sh/guide/integration/format-product.html#product-entity) - minimal set of product fields and how they are used by VSF.
- [Category entity](https://sfa-docs.now.sh/guide/integration/format-category.html) - minimal set of category fields and how they are used by VSF.
- [Attribute entity](https://sfa-docs.now.sh/guide/integration/format-attribute.html) - minimal set of attribute fields and how they are used by VSF.

## 15. Quite handy features in config file properties

Vue Storefront contains some pretty useful config variables that are sometimes missed but can be pretty useful (worth mentioning two times!) :

- `dynamicConfigReload` - by default the config files are processed by [`node-config`](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) only during the build process; whenever you modify the config file, it must be then re-compiled and bundled into `app.js`. However, with this mode on, the [`core/scripts/server.ts`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/77efcdc40a1a69191f8d96c381535517e801820d/core/scripts/server.ts#L271) reloads the config file with each request. This might be very useful for the scalability purposes and to pass some dynamic information during the build process. By modifying the `dynamicConfigExclude` and `dynamicConfigInclude` arrays you may change which particular sections of the config file are provided to the user browser and which are not. The config is passed via `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

- `useExactUrlsNoProxy` - when set to `true`, the strings set in the product properties: `thumbnail`, `image` ... are used for the `<img ` tags without the `/api/img` middleware - as a raw strings.

## 16. Cloudflare Autopurge
You might use CDN not only to serve dist & assets directory but also SSR Output. In this case, you would want to dynamiclly purge cache in Cloudflare when it is being purged in Varnish. 
There is a 3rd party module just for that! Install the module at [here](https://github.com/new-fantastic/vsf-cloudflare)


<br />
<br />

## 17. VSF Cache Varnish
By default VSF is able to cache SSR Output in the Redis Cache. This module will Cache Redis Output in the Varnish. So Node.js server is not being used even to load output from Redis. It makes our app's first load even faster! Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/new-fantastic/vsf-cache-varnish)


<br />
<br />


## 18. VSF Cache NGINX
By default VSF is able to cache SSR Output in the Redis Cache. This module will Cache Redis Output in the NGINX. So Node.js server is not being used even to load output from Redis. It makes our app's first load even faster! Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/new-fantastic/vsf-cache-nginx)

## 19. Vue Storefront 1 config validator for Magento 1 and Magento 2

There is a simple PHP CLI tool to check whether your Vue Storefront PWA configuration matches the structure of your Magento site. You can rest assured whether your VSF works seamlessly with Magento 1 or Magento 2. Please follow the install [here](https://github.com/yireo/vsf-config-validator)


<br />
<br />

## 20. A sample theme to start with

This [sample theme](https://github.com/yireo-training/vsf-yireo-theme) can help you start with a Webpack configuration to allow for simple parent/child theming.


<br />
<br />

## 21. Optimized Webpack configuration for Vue Storefront 1 development
The default Webpack configuration of Vue Storefront 1 allows for fully testing all features. However, because of various reasons, this leads to a slow transpilation time and therefore a bad developer experience. This [repository](https://github.com/yireo-training/vsf1-local-webpack) contains a separate Webpack

## 22. Get rid of depracatedActions in VSF 1.12+
We do not want to make **breaking changes** (only in special situation). That's why we left *depracatedActions* in product's vuex module. If you started your project in 1.12 you can be almost 100% sure that you can get rid of this file which will result in **31.75KB** less app.js bundle! In simple words, you can do that if your app does not use any of *depracatedActions*.

To do that:
1. Remove `core/modules/catalog/store/product/deprecatedActions.ts`
2. In `core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts`, remove 317-318 lines:
```ts
/** Below actions are not used from 1.12 and can be removed to reduce bundle */
  ...require('./deprecatedActions').default
```
