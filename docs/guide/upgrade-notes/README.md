# Upgrade notes

We're trying to keep the upgrade process as easy as possible. Unfortunately, sometimes manual code changes are required. Before pulling out the latest version, please take a look at the upgrade notes below:

## 1.12 -> 1.13

### Multistore

`storeCode` is now required for storeView
`url` is now responsible for creating internal prefix. So `appendStoreCode` is not needed anymore (It is left for compatibility)
For example:
```
{
  storeCode: 'de',
  appendStoreCode: true
}
```
Results in `/de` prefix for routes. Same thing can be done with:
```
{
  storeCode: 'de',
  url: '/de'
}
```
We can also create different url (https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/issues/3614) then `/${storeCode}`:
```
{
  storeCode: 'de',
  url: '/de_de'
}
```

Previously `mapStoreUrlsFor` needed to has same values as storeViews object props **and** storeCode. Now its changed and it's only related with storeViews object props.
Prev:
```
    "storeViews": {
      "mapStoreUrlsFor": ["de"],// 1. this need to match 2. and 3.
      "de": { // 2.
        "storeCode": "de" // 3.
      }
    }
```
Now:
```
    "storeViews": {
      "mapStoreUrlsFor": ["german"],// 1. this need to match 2.
      "german": { // 2.
        "storeCode": "de" // 3.
      }
    }
```
`mapStoreUrlsFor` is only used to disable storeView.

`defaultStoreCode` it is recommended to set some value for it. It is used only used when `multistore` is enabled. You can think about `defaultStoreCode` as fallback for multistore. For example: if you define German store on `"url": "/de"` and Italian store on `"url": "/it"`. Then you can decide which of those stores will be default one and will be reached on `"/"`. If you set `"defaultStoreCode": "de"` then on `"/"` you will have German store.

`removeStoreCodeFromRoute` is replaced by `removeLocalization`

### `vue-lazyload` was removed from the core, if you rely on this package make sure to explicitly add it as a theme or module level dependency.

### Device module
Since this version module does not work by registering it inside `src/modules/client.ts`. You have to import `injectDeviceTests` from `src/modules/device` inside your theme's `index.js`. Call it inside `initTheme` method like that:
```js
injectDeviceTests({
  config,
  app,
  ssrContext
})
```

Then you will have access to the `this.$device`. However, you cannot access it via `Vue.prototype.$device` anymore. That's why, it is possible you will need to move some parts of asyncData to Vue 2.6's `serverPrefetch`.

Another part you should keep in mind is Cache Key. If you render different components based on some data from user agent then you have to build proper cache key based one that. Otherwise, you might end up in situation when mobile SSR Output is being served for desktop users.

I created dedicated hook to resolve this problem. You can find how to use it in `src/modules/device/README.md`. You also have commented example of usage in `src/modules/device/server.ts`.

### core/data-resolver/UserService.ts
`updateProfile` uses `TaskQueue.execute` instead of `TaskQueue.queue`

### core/pages/MyAccount.js
Got rid of `myAccount-before-remainInEditMode`, `myAccount-before-updateUser` events, and `onBeforeUpdateUser` method as a part of this issue [#5315](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/5315). Thanks to that we simplified developer API

### core/modules/user/components/UserAccount.ts
Changed signature of an `exitSection` method from the `(event, updatedProfile)` to the `(updatedProfile)`
### core/modules/user/components/UserShippingDetails.ts
Changed signature of an `exitSection` method from the `(event, updatedShippingDetails)` to the `(updatedShippingDetails)`

### Allow to configure the list of ElasticSearch indices (entityTypes)

For big custom features we might need to add new ElasticSearch indices (entityTypes).
And to be able to make requests into those new indices, we need to be able to add those indices to the SearchAdapter class.
Thus it's good to be able to customize them via config file.

#### Changes

Get data in search adapters from config, rather than hardcoded array: <br>
`core/lib/search/adapter/api/searchAdapter.ts`<br>
`core/lib/search/adapter/api-search-query/searchAdapter.ts`


Add `entityTypes` field to the `config/default.json` config, where elastic search indices can be configured:
```json
 "elasticsearch": {
    "httpAuth": "",
    "host": "/api/catalog",
    "entityTypes": [
      "product",
      "attribute",
      "category",
      "taxrule",
      "review",
      "cms_page",
      "cms_block",
      "cms_hierarchy"
    ],
    ...
 }
```

**Check order optimization settings**

Placing order payload size has been optimised by exclude some attributes, Please review the excluded attributes list `orders.excludeFields` in `config/default.json`, and if you have more custom attributes you want to excluded, copy the following fragment to the `config/local.json` and add the required fields:
```json
  "orders": {
    "excludeFields": ["created_at", "updated_at", "attributes_metadata", "stock", "totals","meta_title", "meta_description", "thumbnail_label", "small_image_label", "image_label","thumbnail", "small_image", "image", "swatch_image", "meta_keyword","rates", "rating", "info", "_score", "weight","visibility", "slug", "url_key", "url_path"]
  }
```


## 1.11 -> 1.12

Most of the changes added to 1.12 are backward compatible. To enable the new features (mostly the optimization features) please follow the steps described below.

**Remove bodybuilder and compact API responses**

The new search adapter `api-search-query` has been added. When you switch to it, by setting the `config.server.api = "api-search-query"` the ElasticSearch query is being built in the [`vue-storefront-api`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api/pull/390) which saves around 400kB in the bundle size as `bodybuilder` is no longer needed in the frontend.

This new `api-search-query` adapter supports the `response_format` query parameter which now is sent to the `/api/catalog` endpoint. Currently there is just one additional format supported: `response_format=compact`. When used, the response format got optimized by: a) remapping the results, removing the `_source` from the `hits.hits`; b) compressing the JSON fields names according to the `config.products.fieldsToCompact`; c) removing the JSON fields from the `product.configurable_children` when their values === parent product values; overall response size reduced over -70%.

**Re-enable amp-renderer**

The `amp-renderer` module has been disabled by default to save the bundle size; If you'd like to enable it uncomment the module from the `src/modules` and uncomment the `product-amp` and `category-amp` links that are added to the `<head>` section in the `src/themes/default/Product.vue` and `src/themes/default/Category.vue`

**Check entity optimization settings**

Cart optimization was earlier disabled automatically if entity optimization was disabled. Now they can be used independently from each other. If you don't want to use cart optimization, make sure that the `entities.optimizeShoppingCart` configuration entry is disabled explicitly.

**deprecated actions and helpers**

Product module has been refactored, here is list of actions that are not used anymore and you can remove them to reduce bundle.

- deprecated actions:
  - product/reset
  - product/setupBreadcrumbs
  - product/syncPlatformPricesOver
  - product/setupAssociated
  - product/loadConfigurableAttributes
  - product/setupVariants
  - product/filterUnavailableVariants
  - product/list
  - product/preConfigureAssociated
  - product/preConfigureProduct
  - product/configureLoadedProducts
  - product/configureBundleAsync
  - product/configureGroupedAsync
  - product/configure
  - product/setCurrentOption
  - product/setCurrentErrors
  - product/setOriginal
  - product/loadProductAttributes
  - category/list (new action is category-next/fetchMenuCategories)

- deprecated helpers:
  - configureProductAsync
  - populateProductConfigurationAsync
  - setConfigurableProductOptionsAsync

Here is list of actions that are used from 1.12 in product module:
- product/doPlatformPricesSync
- product/single
- product/checkConfigurableParent
- product/findProducts
- product/findConfigurableParent
- product/setCustomOptions
- product/setBundleOptions
- product/setCurrent
- product/loadProduct
- product/addCustomOptionValidator
- product/setProductGallery
- product/loadProductBreadcrumbs
- product/getProductVariant

All of those actions and helpers that are deprecated, can be removed so you will have smaller bundle.
Comment those lines:
- core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts:318
- core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts:14-18
- core/modules/catalog-next/store/category/actions.ts:265

## 1.10 -> 1.11

This is the last major release of Vue Storefront 1.x before 2.0 therefore more manual updates are required to keep external packages compatible with 1.x as long as possible.
- `src/modules/index.ts` was renamed to `client.ts`, exported property was renamed to `registerClientModules`
- Output compression module has been added; it's enabled by default on production builds; to disable it please switch the `src/modules/server.ts` configuration
- The [`formatCategoryLink`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/modules/url/helpers/index.ts) now supports multistore - adding the `storeCode` when necessary; it could have caused double store prefixes like `/de/de` - but probably only in the Breadcrumbs (#3359)
- All modules were refactored to new API. You can still register modules in previous format until 2.0
- `DroppointShipping` and `magento-2-cms `modules were deleted
- example modules moved to https://github.com/vuestorefront/vsf-samples
- `core/helpers/initCacheStorage.ts` merged with `StorageManager.ts` (import path alias for backward compatibility added)
- Old extensions mechanism (before VS 1.4) was finally removed after being deprecated for almost a year (`src/extensions` removal)
- Cache collections were reorganized. In most cases Local Storage keys remained untouched, only collection keys were unified. also they're used only in the core. Posting changes in case someone is using those collections in their modules;
  - `syncTaskCollection` renamed to `syncTasks`
  - `compareCollection` renamed to `compare`
  - `cmsData` renamed to `cms`
  - `cartsCollection` renamed to `carts`
  - `checkoutFieldValues`, `checkoutFieldsCollection` renamed to `checkout` (`checkoutFieldsCollection` wasn’t used)
  - `ordersCollection` and `orders` renamed to just `orders` (`ordersCollection` wasn’t used)
  - `elasticCacheCollection` renamed to `elasticCache`
  - `usersCollection` `usersData` merged and renamed to `user`
  - `attributesCollection`, `attributes` renamed to just `attributes`
  - `ordersHistoryCollection` merged to `user` cache where it belongs
  - `categoriesCollection` renamed to categories
  - Collections in theme like `claimsCollection` (claims modules) remained untouched
- `UserOrder` component has been renamed to `UserOrderHistory` and moved from `src/modules/order-history/components/UserOrders` to `@vue-storefront/core/modules/order/components/UserOrdersHistory`. This component was used in `MyOrders` component found here: `src/themes/default/components/core/blocks/MyAccount/MyOrders.vue`. In this file the `import` path has to be updated.
- `claims`, `promoted-offers`, `homepage` and `ui` modules have been moved from `@vue-storefront/src/modules` to `src/themes/default/store/` and reduced to stores only.<br>
Delete those folders:<br>
  -- `src/modules/claims`<br>
  -- `src/modules/promoted-offers`<br>
  -- `src/modules/homepage`<br>
  -- `src/modules/ui-store`<br>
Copy folder `theme/store/` from `theme default`.<br>
Register the stores copied in previous step in `src/themes/default/index.js`. To do that, import them along with `StorageManager` method, used to replace `claims beforeRegistration hook`.
```js
import { StorageManager } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/storage-manager';
import { store as claimsStore } from 'theme/store/claims'
import { store as homeStore } from 'theme/store/homepage'
import { store as uiStore } from 'theme/store/ui'
import { store as promotedStore } from 'theme/store/promoted-offers'
```
Next, inside `initTheme` method use `store.registerModule` method to register the stores.
```js
StorageManager.init('claims');
store.registerModule('claims', claimsStore);
store.registerModule('homepage', homeStore);
store.registerModule('ui', uiStore);
store.registerModule('promoted', promotedStore);
```
- `WebShare` moved from `@vue-storefront/core/modules/social-share/components/WebShare.vue` to `@vue-storefront/src/themes/default/components/theme/WebShare.vue`. This component was used in `Product` component found here: `src/themes/default/pages/Product.vue`. In this file the `import` path has to be updated.

- We've fixed the naming strategy for product prices; The following fields were renamed: `special_priceInclTax` -> `special_price_incl_tax`, `priceInclTax` -> `price_incl_tax`, `priceTax` -> `price_tax`; The names have been kept and marked as @deprecated. These fields will be **removed with Vue Storefront 2.0rc-1**.
- We've decreased the `localStorage` quota usage + error handling by introducing new config variables:
- `config.products.disablePersistentProductsCache` to not store products by SKU (by default it's on). Products are cached in ServiceWorker cache anyway so the `product/findProducts` will populate the in-memory cache (`cache.setItem(..., memoryOnly = true)`);
- `config.seo.disableUrlRoutesPersistentCache` - to not store the url mappings; they're stored in in-memory cache anyway so no additional requests will be made to the backend for url mapping; however it might cause some issues with url routing in the offline mode (when the offline mode PWA installed on homescreen got reloaded, the in-memory cache will be cleared so there won't potentially be the url mappings; however the same like with `product/findProducts` the ServiceWorker cache SHOULD populate url mappings anyway);
- `config.syncTasks.disablePersistentTaskQueue` to not store the network requests queue in service worker. Currently only the stock-check and user-data changes were using this queue. The only downside it introduces can be related to the offline mode and these tasks will not be re-executed after connectivity established, but just in a case when the page got reloaded while offline (yeah it might happen using ServiceWorker; `syncTasks` can't be re-populated in cache from SW)
- We've moved files from /store/lib to /lib. Basically to use it from the new directory you have to import now from `@vue-storefront/core/lib/store/` instead of `@vue-storefront/core/store/lib/`. These core files got changed:
```js
core/build/webpack.base.config.ts
core/lib/sync/task.ts
core/lib/storage-manager.ts
core/modules/catalog/helpers/search.ts
core/modules/catalog/store/attribute/mutations.ts
core/modules/catalog/store/category/actions.ts
core/modules/catalog/store/category/mutations.ts
core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts
core/modules/catalog/store/tax/mutations.ts
core/modules/compare/store/actions.ts
core/modules/order/store/mutations.ts
core/modules/order/index.ts
core/modules/wishlist/store/actions.ts
```
If by some reasons you wan't to have the `localStorage` back on for `Products by SKU`, `Url Routes` and `SyncTasks` - please just set these variables back to `false` in your `config/local.json`.

- New page-not-found handling requires to update router/index.js in the theme.
- The option `config.ssr.lazyHydrateFor` with `category-next.products` value was introduced which is responsible for hydrating products list and loading them only on client side. It means there is no category products in the `__INITIAL__STATE__`. It's enabled by default.
- The modules: `Review`, `Mailer`, `Order`, `RecentlyViewed`, `InstantCheckout` are no longer loaded by default in the main bundle as they are loading on-demand on the related pages.
- Authentication guard was moved from user module router to `MyAccount` pages mixin.
- The getters `cmsBlocks`, `cmsBlockIdentifier`, `cmsBlockId` are deprecated. Please use `getCmsBlocks`, `getCmsBlockIdentifier`, `getCmsBlockId` instead.
- Translations for "Order #", "Price ", "Select size ", "You are logged in as" and "items" changed, they now include a placeholder for the value. Please refer to [this commit](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/pull/3550/commits/366d31bf28a1e27a7f14b222369cba8fe0a6d3e0) in order to adjust them, otherwise they might get lost.
- `i18n.currencySignPlacement` config value is replaced by `i18n.priceFormat` so price format becomes more flexible
- Theme initialization needs to be modified in customized themes
  - Delete the line `RouterManager.addRoutes(routes, router, true)`. This is now handled in `setupMultistoreRoutes`, including the default store.
  - Optionally give theme routes priority, to ensure they override module routes if there are any conflicts. For example `setupMultistoreRoutes(config, router, routes, 10)`.
  - See `/src/themes/default/index.js` for a complete example.
- In `storeView` config there is no more `disabled` flag for specific language config. Links for other languages will be displayed if specific `storeView` config exist.
- Categories can be filtered globally, to never be loaded, by setting `entities.category.filterFields` in local.json, e.g. `"filterFields": { "is_active": true }`.
- Categories can be filtered in the Breadcrumbs, by setting `entities.category.breadcrumbFilterFields` in local.json, e.g. `"breadcrumbFilterFields": { "include_in_menu": true }`.
## 1.10 -> 1.10.4

We've decreased the `localStorage` quota usage + error handling by introducing new config variables:

- `config.products.disablePersistentProductsCache` to not store products by SKU (by default it's on). Products are cached in ServiceWorker cache anyway so the `product/findProducts` will populate the in-memory cache (`cache.setItem(..., memoryOnly = true)`);
- `config.seo.disableUrlRoutesPersistentCache` - to not store the url mappings; they're stored in in-memory cache anyway so no additional requests will be made to the backend for url mapping; however it might cause some issues with url routing in the offline mode (when the offline mode PWA installed on homescreen got reloaded, the in-memory cache will be cleared so there won't potentially be the url mappings; however the same like with `product/findProducts` the ServiceWorker cache SHOULD populate url mappings anyway);
- `config.syncTasks.disablePersistentTaskQueue` to not store the network requests queue in service worker. Currently only the stock-check and user-data changes were using this queue. The only downside it introuces can be related to the offline mode and these tasks will not be re-executed after connectivity established, but just in a case when the page got reloaded while offline (yeah it might happen using ServiceWorker; `syncTasks` can't be re-populated in cache from SW)

If by some reasons you wan't to have the `localStorage` back on for `Products by SKU`, `Url Routes` and `SyncTasks` - please juset set these variables back to `false` in your `config/local.json`.


## 1.9 -> 1.10
- Event `application-after-init` is now emitted by event bus instead of root Vue instance (app), so you need to listen to `Vue.prototype.$bus` (`EventBus.$on()`) now
- The lowest supported node version  is currently 8.10.0,
- Module Mailchimp is removed in favor of Newsletter. `local.json` configuration under key `mailchimp` moved to key `newsletter`.
- In multistore mode now there is a possibility to skip appending storecode to url with `appendStoreCode` config option. To keep the original behavior, it should be set to true. - @lukeromanowicz (#3048).
- The `cart/addItem` is no longer displaying the error messages - please use the `diffLog.clientNorifications` to update the UI instead (take a look at the `AddToCart.ts` for a reference)
- Please make sure your `AddToCart.vue` component has the `notifyUser` method defined for showing the errors / success messages while adding to the cart. The default implementation is:

```js
    notifyUser (notificationData) {
      this.$store.dispatch('notification/spawnNotification', notificationData, { root: true })
    }
```
- The getter `cart/totals` has been replaced with `cart/getTotals` - @pkarw (#2522)
- The getter `cart/coupon` has been replaced with `cart/getCoupon` - @pkarw (#2522)
- The getter `cart/totalQuantity` has been replaced with `cart/getItemsTotalQuantity` - @pkarw (#2522)

## 1.8 -> 1.9
- The Url Dispatcher feature added for friendly URLs. When `config.seo.useUrlDispatcher` set to true the `product.url_path` and `category.url_path` fields are used as absolute URL addresses (no `/c` and `/p` prefixes anymore). Check the latest `mage2vuestorefront` snapshot and **reimport Your products** to properly set `url_path` fields
- `cart.multisiteCommonCart` config property changed to `storeViews.commonCache`
- Way of creating VS Modules was changed to use factory method instead of explict object creation. Even though the feature is backward compatible we highly encourage all developers to refactor their modules to use new syntax.

The process of creating a new module with the factory method looks like the following:
````js
import { createModule } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/module'

const moduleConfig: VueStorefrontModuleConfig = {
  // VS module config
}

const module = createModule(moduleConfig)
````
- `@vue-storefront/store` package has been depreciated. Just change imports to `@vue-storefront/core/store`.
- `breadCrumbRoutes` helper has been refactored to `formatBreadCrumbRoutes`
- orders which fail validation in API are assumed to have http code 400 instead of 500
- notification message about invalid order address now uses email configured in mailer section instead of hardcoded one
- Added validation for UTF8 alpha and alphanumeric characters in most checkout fields
- Update your local.json config and set default `api.url` path, without it you may have problems with elasticsearch queries.

### Troubleshooting
- In case of CORS problem after upgrade check your elasticsearch url in config file. Best practice for that change can be found [here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/commit/77fc9c2765068303879c75ef9ed4a4b98f6763b6)

- In case of app crashing, especially when opening `vue devtools` in browser, try setting `storeViews.commonCache` to `false`.

## 1.7 -> 1.8

- `src/themes/default/index.template.html` has been moved to `src/themes/default/templates/index.template.html`

## 1.6 -> 1.7

Starting from Vue Storefront 1.7, we changed the caching strategy and offline-ready features:
- By default, the Elasticsearch Queries are executed using `GET` method and therefore are cached by Service Worker (`config.elasticsearch.queryMethod` — set it to POST for the previous behavior and if you're using graphql).
- By default, products and queries cache is set in `LocalStorage` with a quota set to 4MB (`config.server.elasticCacheQuota`). If the storage quota is set, the cache purging is executed every 30 seconds using the LRU algorithm. Local Storage is limited to 5MB in most browsers.
- We added `config.server. disablePersistentQueriesCache`, which is set to `true` by default. When this option is on, we're not storing the Elasticsearch results in the local cache because results are by default cached in the Service Worker cache anyway.
- `module.extend` has been changed to `extendModule`. You can find usage examples in `src/modules/index.ts`.
- [routes](https://github.com/patzick/vue-storefront/commit/a97eb11868de2915e86d57c4279caf944d4de422#diff-a334a7caeb7f61836f8c1178d92de3e0), [layouts](https://github.com/patzick/vue-storefront/commit/a97eb11868de2915e86d57c4279caf944d4de422#diff-48863b9fe31d7713222ec5709ef5a4fa), and component, which are not visible at page rendering are now loaded when they are needed.
- Every store manipulation should be done by dispatching actions. Invoke store dispatch on `category/mergeSearchOptions` when manipulating `store.state.category.current_product_query` somewhere.
- [here](https://github.com/patzick/vue-storefront/commit/a97eb11868de2915e86d57c4279caf944d4de422) are all changes in default themes

Backward compatibility: To reverse to the 1.0–1.6 behavior:
- Set `config.server.disablePersistentQueriesCache` = `false`,
- Set `config.elasticsearch.queryMethod` = `POST`
- Set `config.localForage.defaultDrivers.elasticCache` = `INDEXEDDB`

**NOTE:** Offline mode may not work properly in development mode (localhost) because of Service Workers and lack of bundle prefetching (bundles lazy loading).

With 1.7, the number of attribute descriptors that are loaded on the product page is limited and dynamically adjusted to the fields used in the product. This behavior shouldn't have any negative impact on your app; however, if you haven’t used the `attribute/list` action explicitly based on all attributes loaded by default (up to 1.6), this may cause problems. You can switch off the dynamic loader by setting the `config.entities.product.useDynamicAttributeLoader=false`. Details: [#2137](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/pull/2137/files)

Dynamic Categories prefetching (#2076). Starting with Vue Storefront 1.7, we added a configuration option `config.entities.category.categoriesDynamicPrefetch` (by default set to `true`). TThis option switches the way the category tree is being fetched. Previously, we were fetching the full categories tree. In some cases, it can generate even a few MB of payload. Currently with this option in place, we're pre-fetching the categories on demand while the user is browsing the category tree.

**NOTE:** Since we're no longer generating `category.slug` client-side, we need to have `category.url_key` field unique. If Your Magento2 url_keys are unique it will work without any changes. If not - please do use [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront) to re-import the categories. There is a new `categories` importer option `--generateUniqueUrlKeys` which is set to true by default.

With the new modules architecture available from 1.6 we've [updated the payment modules guide](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/pull/2135). If You've used the custom payment (and basically any other) extensions please make sure You've already ported them to [new modules architecture](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/modules/introduction.html).


## 1.5 -> 1.6

With 1.6, we introduced new modular architecture and moved most of the theme-specific logic from the core to the default theme. It's probably the biggest update in VS history and the first step to making future upgrades more seamless.

Due to architectural changes, `core/components` and `core/store/modules` folders were removed and reorganised into modules ( `core/modules`). In most cases, the components API remained the same (if not, we provided an API bridge in `core/compatibility/components` folder which allows you to benefit from new features without making changes in your theme). It's a good idea to look for imports referring to deleted folders after migration to be sure that we made a full update.

Overall, the theme upgrade for the default theme requires 105 files to be changed, but 85% of these changes are just a new import paths for the core component, which makes this update time-consuming, but easy to follow and not risky.

[Here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/commit/cc17b5bfa43a9510815aea14dce8bafac382bc7f) you can find detailed information (as an upgrade commit with notes) about what needs to be changed in the theme to support VS 1.6.

#### Global changes
- Notifications are now based on Vuex Store instead of Event Bus. We also pulled hardcoded notifications from core to theme.

Change every component:
````js
this.$bus.$emit('notification',
````
to:
````js
this.$store.dispatch('notification/spawnNotification',
````
Change every store:
````js
EventBus.$emit('notification',
````
to:
````js
rootStore.dispatch('notification/spawnNotification',
````
and make sure you are importing `rootStore`.

- Lazy loading for non-SSR routes is now available.

You can now [use dynamic imports to lazy load non-SSR routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html). You can find examples from the default theme [here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/tree/develop/src/themes/default/router)

- Extensions are now rewritten to modules (and the extensions system will be depreciated in 1.7).

If you haven't modified any extensions directly, you don't need to change anything. If you made such changes, you probably need to rewrite your extension to a module.

- The old event bus is moved to the compatibility folder. From now we are trying to create new features without it and slowly depreciate the event bus whenever possible. It'll be replaced with some enhanced module-based mechanism with event autosuggestion support.

Change all `@vue-storefront/core/plugins/event-bus` imports to `@vue-storefront/core/compatibility/plugins/event-bus`

#### Components that were moved or the API was changed and the compatibility component was created.

Required action: Change the import path. In case of additional changes click on a component name to see how to update.

## 1.4 -> 1.5

### Modifications

#### New Modules API

With 1.5.0, we introduced a new, heavily refactored modules API. We tried to keep the old theme components backward compatible, so now you can view some "mock" components in the `/core/components` referencing to the `/modules/<module>/components` original. Please read [how modules work and are structured](../modules/introduction.md) to check if it implies any changes to your theme. Though it may seem like a lot of changes (a lot of files were added/removed/renamed), it should not impact your custom code.

#### New Newsletter module

The existing newsletter-integration module was pretty chaotic and messy. @filrak has rewritten it from scratch. If you've relied on existing newsletter module logic / events / etc., it could have affected your code (low probability).

#### Memory leaks fixed

We fixed SSR memory leaks with #1882. It should not affect your custom code, but if you've modified any SSR features, please make sure that everything still works just fine.

## 1.3 -> 1.4

### Modifications

#### GraphQL

We added GraphQL support. Please read more on the [GraphQL Action Plan](/guide/basics/graphql.html). Starting from this release, the **bodybuilder** package is **deprecated**. You should use the **SearchQuery** internal class that can be used against API and GraphQL endpoints. Read more on [how to query data](/guide/data/elastic-queries.html).

#### SSR: Advanced output and cache

This change does not involve any required actions to port the code, but please be aware that we're supporting [SSR Cache](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/doc/SSR%20Cache.md) + [dynamic layout changes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/develop/doc/Layouts%20and%20advanced%20output%20operations.md) etc. If you're using the modified version of the theme, you can hardly use these without updating `themes/YourTheme/App.vue` to the new format (check the default theme for details).

#### Reviews

We added Reviews support, however, Magento 2 is still lacking Reviews support in the REST API. To have reviews up and running, please add the https://github.com/divanteLtd/magento2-review-api to your Magento 2 instance.

#### Microcart

1. We moved core functionalities of coupon codes to API modules:

   - **Coupon** computed value is now **appliedCoupon** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))
   - **removeCoupon** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))
   - **applyCoupon** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))
   - **totals** -> **cartTotals** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))
   - **shipping** -> **cartShipping** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))
   - **payment** -> **cartPayment** ([read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/api-modules/cart.md))

2. We moved/renamed methods responsible for UI to the default theme:
   - **addDiscountCoupon** - toggle coupon form
   - **removeCoupon** -> **clearCoupon** - removing coupon by dispatch removeCoupon API method and toggle coupon form
   - **applyCoupon** -> **setCoupon** - submit coupon form by dispatch applyCoupon API method
   - **enterCoupon** - was removed, because @keyup="enterCoupon" we changed to @keyup.enter="setCoupon"

3. We moved $emit with notification about appliedCoupon and removedCoupon from Vuex store to the default theme. Now applyCoupon and removeCoupon returns promise, which you can handle by yourself.

4. We moved VueOfflineMixin and onEscapePress mixins to the theme component. The core component is clean from UI stuff now.

5. We've replaced one method `Microcart` - `cartTotals` -> `totals`

#### Assets

1. We removed the default assets from `core/assets`. From now on, we only use the assets from `your-theme/assets`.

#### Store

1. We moved the socialTiles Vuex store from the core to the theme, because it's specific to the theme.

#### i18n

1. We removed all the theme-specific translations for the core.

## 1.2 -> 1.3

### Changes

1. We removed event emit from client-entry.js with online status information. Instead, we are now using [vue-offline](https://github.com/filrak/vue-offline) mixin. [#1494](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/1494)
2. We removed the isOnline variable from Microcart.js. Instead, we are now using variables from [vue-offline](https://github.com/filrak/vue-offline) mixin. [#1494](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/1494)

### Upgrade step-by-step

#### `global.$VS` replaced with `rootStore` and `config` was moved to `config`

To get access to rootStore, import it by

`import config from 'config'`

#### cms extenstion was renamed to extension-magento2-cms

Import of CmsData must be changed in `CustomCmsPage.vue` component to:

`import CmsData from '@vue-storefront/extension-magento2-cms/components/CmsData'`

## 1.1 -> 1.2 ([release notes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/releases/tag/v1.2.0))

There were no breaking-changes introduced. No special treatment needed 😃

## 1.0 -> 1.1 ([release notes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/releases/tag/v1.1.0))

### Modifications

#### Plugins registration simplified

Instead of exporting an object in `{theme}/plugins/index.js` just use `Vue.use(pugin)` directly in this file ( [docs](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/Working%20with%20plugins.md) )

#### Microcart logic moved to API module (partially)

Starting from Microcart, we are moving most of the logic to core modules along with unit testing them. [Read more](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/1213).

Changes that happened in `Microcart.js` core component and `Microcart.vue` component from default theme:

- `closeMicrocart` renamed to `closeMicrocartExtend`
- `items` renamed to `productsInCart`
- `removeFromCart`method added to core Microcart

#### `theme/app-extend.js` removed

It was redundant.

#### `{theme}/service-worker-ext.js` moved to `{theme}/service-worker/index.js`

Now it mirrors `core/` folder structure, which is desired behaviour.

### vue-storefront-api docker support has been extended

We added the possibility to run the `vue-storefront-api` fully in Docker (previously, just the Elastic and Redis images were present in the `docker-compose.yml`. Please read the [README.md](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api) for more details.

**PLEASE NOTE:** We changed the structure of the `elasticsearch` section of the config files, moving `esIndexes` to `elasticsearch.indices` etc. There is an automatic migration that will update your config files automatically by running: `yarn migrate` in the `vue-storefront-api` folder.

### Default storage of the shopping carts and user data moved to localStorage

Currently, there is a config option to set up the default local storage configs: https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/271a33fc6e712b978e10b91447b05529b6d04801/config/default.json#L148. If you like the previous behavior of storing the carts in the indexedDb, please change the config backend to `INDEXEDDB`.

### mage2vuestorefront improvements

A lot of improvements have been added to the [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront) importer. importer. For example, fixed special_price sync. For such changes, please update [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/mage2vuestorefront) and re-import your products. We also added the dynamic on/demand indexing.

### New features

We added [`vue-progressbar`](https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-progressbar) to default theme, which can be found in `App.vue` file.

## 1.0RC-3 -> 1.0([release notes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/releases/tag/v1.0.0))

This is the official, stable release of Vue Storefront.

1. We renamed `the core/components/*.vue` -> `the core/components/*.js`
2. We renamed `the core/pages/*.vue` -> `the core/pages/*.js`
3. We removed `corePage` and `coreComponent` helpers and created an es-lint rule to migrate the `import` statements automatically (with `--fix` parameter)

You should replace the mixin declarations from the previous version:

```vue
<script>
import { coreComponent } from '@vue-storefront/core/lib/themes';

export default {
  mixins: [coreComponent('blocks/MyAccount/MyOrders')],
};
</script>
```

to

```vue
<script>
import MyOrders from '@vue-storefront/core/components/blocks/MyAccount/MyOrders';

export default {
  mixins: [MyOrders],
};
</script>
```

4. We've added Multistore support. It shouldn't imply any breaking changes to the existing themes / extensions (by default it's just disabled).

## 1.0RC-2 -> 1.0RC-3 ([release notes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3))

This release contains three important refactoring efforts:

1. We changed the user-account endpoints and added the token-reneval mechanism, which is configured by
`config.users.autoRefreshTokens`. If set to true and user token will expire, VS will try to refresh it.

2. We separated the user-account endpoints, so please copy the following defaults from `default.json` to Your `local.json` and set the correct API endpoints:

```json
    "users": {
      "autoRefreshTokens": true,
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user",
      "history_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/order-history?token={{token}}",
      "resetPassword_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/reset-password",
      "changePassword_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/change-password?token={{token}}",
      "login_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/login",
      "create_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/create",
      "me_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/me?token={{token}}",
      "refresh_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/refresh"
    },
```

The endpoints are also set by the `yarn installer` so You can try to reinstall VS using this command.

3. We optimized the performance by limiting the fields loaded each time in JSON objects from the backend. Please review the `config/default.json`and if some fields required / used by your app are missing, copy the following fragment to the `config/local.json` and add the required fields:

```json
    "entities": {
      "optimize": true,
      "twoStageCaching": true,
      "category": {
        "includeFields": [ "children_data", "id", "children_count", "sku", "name", "is_active", "parent_id", "level" ]
      },
      "attribute": {
        "includeFields": [ "attribute_code", "id", "entity_type_id", "options", "default_value", "is_user_defined", "frontend_label", "attribute_id", "default_frontend_label", "is_visible_on_front", "is_visible", "is_comparable" ]
      },
      "productList": {
        "includeFields": [ "type_id", "sku", "name", "price", "priceInclTax", "original_price_incl_tax", "id", "image", "sale", "new" ],
        "excludeFields": [ "configurable_children", "description", "configurable_options", "sgn", "tax_class_id" ]
      },
      "productListWithChildren": {
        "includeFields": [ "type_id", "sku", "name", "price", "priceInclTax", "original_price_incl_tax", "id", "image", "sale", "new", "configurable_children.image", "configurable_children.sku", "configurable_children.price", "configurable_children.special_price", "configurable_children.price_incl_tax", "configurable_children.special_price_incl_tax", "configurable_children.original_price", "configurable_children.original_price_incl_tax", "configurable_children.color", "configurable_children.size" ],
        "excludeFields": [ "description", "sgn", "tax_class_id" ]
      },
      "product": {
        "excludeFields": [ "updated_at", "created_at", "attribute_set_id", "status", "visibility", "tier_prices", "options_container", "url_key", "msrp_display_actual_price_type", "has_options", "stock.manage_stock", "stock.use_config_min_qty", "stock.use_config_notify_stock_qty", "stock.stock_id",  "stock.use_config_backorders", "stock.use_config_enable_qty_inc", "stock.enable_qty_increments", "stock.use_config_manage_stock", "stock.use_config_min_sale_qty", "stock.notify_stock_qty", "stock.use_config_max_sale_qty", "stock.use_config_max_sale_qty", "stock.qty_increments", "small_image"],
        "includeFields": null
      }
    },
```

If `optimize` is set to false, it's a fallback to the previous behaviour (getting all fields).

4. Another cool feature is `twoStageCaching` enabled by default. It means that for the Category page, VS is getting only the minimum number of JSON fields required to display the ProductTiles. Shortly after, it downloads the full objects by the second request to store them in the local cache.

5. We tweaked the Service Worker to better cache the app; it sometimes can generate frustration if your home page is now cached in the SW (previously was not). Feel free to use `Clear Storage` in your Developers tools :)

6. The `mage2vuestorefront` tool got update and now it's loading the `media_gallery` with additional media per product. We also put some MediaGallery components on the product page.

7.Product and Category pages got refactored. It's a massive refactoring moving all the logic to the Vuex stores, so if you played with the core `fetchData`/`loadData` functions, your code may be affected by this change.

## 1.0RC -> 1.0RC-2 ([release notes](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2))

This release brings some cool new features (Magento 1.x support, Magento 2 external checkout, My Orders, Discount Codes) together with some minor refactors.

Unfortunately, with the refactors comes two manual changes that need to be applied to your custom themes after the update.

Here You can check an **[example how did we migrated our own default_m1 theme to RC-2](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/commit/111519c04acec272657e7eefec7ea8405da95f13)**.

1. We changed `ColorButton`, `SizeButton`, `PriceButton` in the `core` to `ColorSelector`, `SizeSelector`, `PriceSelector` and added the `GenericSelector` for all other attribute types. Because of this change, the `coreComponent('ColorButton')` must be changed to `coreComponent('ColorSelector')` etc.

2. We added the Vuex Stores extensibility to the themes. If You're getting the following build error:

```
ERROR in ./core/store/index.js
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'theme/store' in '***/vue-storefront/core/store'
```

It means, that you need to copy the template store to: `<Your custom theme folder>/store`.
