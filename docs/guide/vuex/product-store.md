# Product Vuex Store

The Product Store is designed to handle all actions related product data. It's responsible for loading the list of products or a single product as well as configuring the configurable products and managing the product attachments.

This module works pretty tightly with Elasticsearch and operates on the [Product data format](../data/elasticsearch.md)

## State

```js
const state = {
  breadcrumbs: { routes: [] },
  current: null, // shown product
  current_options: { color: [], size: [] },
  current_configuration: {},
  parent: null,
  list: [],
  original: null, // default, not configured product
  related: {},
};
```

The product state is generally populated by just two methods - [list](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L395) and [single](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L428) - and cleared to the defaults by [reset](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L215).

The product state data:

- `breadcrumbs` - This is the list of routes used by the [Breadcrumbs component](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/components/Breadcrumbs.js)
- `current` - This is the product object with selected `configurable_children` variant, so it's the base product with attributes overridden by the values from selected `configurable_children` variant; it's used on [Product.vue page](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/pages/Product.vue#L203). This is the product which is added to the cart after "Add to cart"
- `current_options` - The list used to populate the variant selector on the [Product.vue page](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/themes/default/pages/Product.vue#L56). It contains dictionary of attributes and possible attribute values and labels, and it's populated by [setupVariants](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L344) based on the `configurable_children` property.
- `current_configuration` The current product configuration. A dictionary of selected variant attributes; for example, it contains a dictionary of selected product attributes:

```json
{
  "color": 123,
  "size": 24
}
```

Please note, we're using the Magento-like EAV attributes structure so the values here are attribute value indexes, not the values itself. Please take a look at [Data formats](../data/elasticsearch.md) for a reference.

- `parent` - If the current product is a `type_id="single"`, then in this variable the parent, `configurable` product is stored. This data is populated only on `Product.vue` by [checkConfigurableParent](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L323)
- `list` - This is an array of products loaded by [list](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L395)
- `original` - Used only for `configurable` products, this is the base product with no selected variant.
- `related` - This is dictionary of related products; set outside this store (for [example here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/master/src/themes/default/components/core/blocks/Product/Related.vue)) by calling and [related action](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L528)

## Events

The following events are published from `product` store:

- `EventBus.$emit('product-after-priceupdate', product)` - from [syncProductPrice](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/blob/bd559f1baad7cd392bc5bae7b935a60484e2e6e5/src/store/modules/product.js#L33) after product price is synced with Magento.
- `EventBus.$emit('product-after-configure', { product: product, configuration: configuration, selectedVariant: selectedVariant })` from `configureProductAsync` (called by `product/configure` action after `product/single`). This event provides the information about selected product variant on the product page.
- `EventBus.$emit('product-after-list', { query: query, start: start, size: size, sort: sort, entityType: entityType, result: resp })` - this event emits the current product list as it's returned by `product/findProducts`providing the current filters, etc. You can mark the specific product list identifier by setting the `meta` property; it's important because on a single page, this event can be executed multiple time for each individual block of products.
- `EventBus.$emit('product-after-single', { key: key, options: options, product: cachedProduct })` - After single product has been loaded (invoked by `product/single` action).

## Actions

The product store provides following public actions:

### `setupBreadcrumbs (context, { product })`

This method is in charge of setting `state.breadcrumbs` to be used on the `Product.vue` page. It's called from `Product.vue:fetchData`. The `product` parameter is an [Elasticsearch product object](../data/elasticsearch.md).

### `syncPlatformPricesOver(context, { skus })`

When the config option `products.alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` is on, Vue Storefront will request the current product prices each time when `product/single` or `product/findProducts` action is dispatched. It's called exclusively by these actions and shouldn't be called manually. This method calls `vue-storefront-api` proxy to get the current prices from Magento or any other backend CMS.

`skus` - this is an array with product SKUs to be synchronized.

### `setupAssociated (context, { product })`

This method is called as a subsequent call of `Product.vue:fetchData` or `product/findProducts` action. It's used to get the child products of `grouped` or `bundle` types of products.

### `checkConfigurableParent (context, {product})`

This method is called by `Product.vue:fetchData` to check if current, simple product has got an configurable parent. If so, the redirect is being made to the parent product. It's a fix for [#508](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/508)

### `setupVariants (context, { product })`

This method is subsequently called by `Product.vue:fetchData` to load all configurable attributes defined in `product.configurable_options` and then to populate `state.current_configuration` and `state.current_options`. The main usage of this action is to prepare a product to be configured by the user on the product page and to display the product configurator UI properly.

### `list (context, { query, start = 0, size = 50, entityType = 'product', sort = '', cacheByKey = 'sku', prefetchGroupProducts = true, updateState = true, meta = {} })`

This is the key method to load the product list. It returns the Promise that contains the product list object. This method should be used everywhere you need to get product data. When `config.tax.calculateServerSide=false` this method runs product taxes calculator and synchronizes prices with Magento if it's required.

**Events**: this method emits product list as `EventBus.$emit('product-after-list', { query: query, start: start, size: size, sort: sort, entityType: entityType, meta: meta, result: resp })`

:::warning Important
This method synchronizes products for offline usage by storing the whole query results object into `localForage` and by caching each product individually (to be used on the product page, for example).
:::

- `query` - This is the `bodybuilder` Elasticsearch query (please check `bodybuilder` package or for example `Home.vue` for a reference how to use it).

- `start`, `size` - Both parameters are used for paging; start is the starting index; size is a page size.

- `entityType` - By default it's of course set to `product` and it's mapped to Elasticsearch entity class.

- `sort` - Product attribute using to sort. This field must be mapped in Elasticsearch as a numeric field,

- `prefetchGroupProducts` - By default, it's set to true and causes the `setupAssociated` action to be dispatched to get all the associated products

- `updateState` - If you set this to false, the `state.list` will not be updated, just the products will be returned.

- `meta` - This is an optional attribute which is returned with the `product-after-list` event; it can be used for example to mark any specific ES call.

### `single (context, { options, setCurrentProduct = true, selectDefaultVariant = true, key = 'sku' })`

This method subsequently dispatches the `product/findProducts` action to get the products and synchronize the taxes/prices. When the product has been recently downloaded via `product/findProducts` this method will return the cached version from `localForage`, but update the cache anyway.

### `configure (context, { product = null, configuration, selectDefaultVariant = true })`

This action is used to configure the `configurable` product with specified attributes. It gets the `configuration` object, which should have the following format: `{ attribute_code: attribute_value_id }` and finds the `product.configurable_children` item which complies with this configuration. Then, it merges this specific `configurable_child` with the product itself - for example, setting the product.price to the configurable price, color, size etc. This method is used on: `Product.vue` page for allowing user to select color, size etc. The second usage for it is on `Category.vue` page after user selects some filters - the resulting products are configured to display the proper images (related to selected color and size) and prices.

If `selectDefaultVariant` is set to true (default), the `state.current` will be altered with configured product.

### `setCurrent (context, productVariant)`

Auxiliary method just to set `state.current` to productVariant.

### `setOriginal (context, originalProduct)`

Auxiliary method just to set `state.original` to originalProduct.

### `related (context, { key = 'related-products', items })`

Alters `state.related` dictionary to set specific list of related products to be displayed on `Product.vue` page (`RelatedProducts` component is used for this).

## Getters

All state members should have been accessed only by getters. Please take a look at the state reference for data formats.

```js
const getters = {
  getParentProduct: state => state.parent,
  getCurrentProduct: state => state.current,
  getCurrentProductConfiguration: state => state.current_configuration,
  getOriginalProduct: state => state.original,
  getCurrentProductOptions: state => state.current_options,
  breadcrumbs: state => state.breadcrumbs,
};
```
