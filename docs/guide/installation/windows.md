# Installing on Windows

Vue Storefront is based on open-source technologies, which should (in theory) work perfectly well on most of the leading operating systems. However, we're developing the project using MacOS and Linux machines.

## Requirements

1. Please download [Docker for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and install it on your machine. [More Information](https://blog.jayway.com/2017/04/19/running-docker-on-bash-on-windows/).
2. Install [LTS version of Node.js for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. Instal [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
4. You can use any editor for development, but we're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is cool, free, and very JS-friendly!
5. You can [download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to get access not only for fancy UI, but for the git toolset itself.

## Installation of vue-storefront-api

1. Open your command line of choice with [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) access or use Github desktop.
2. Clone the [vue-storefront-api](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api) project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront-api.git vue-storefront-api
```

3. Go to `vue-storefront-api` in dir:

```bash
cd vue-storefront-api
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

5. Run Docker containers required by `vue-storefront-api`:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This step can take a few minutes.

Note: If it appears that docker-compose is hanging, try opening a new terminal and continue to the next step using that terminal. Allow docker-compose to continue running in the background.

6. Restore products database and run the latest migrations.

```bash
yarn restore
yarn migrate
```

7. Copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json`.
8. Run API:

```bash
yarn dev
```

1. Open your command line of choice with [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) access or use Github desktop.
2. Clone the [vue-storefront](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront) project:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront.git vue-storefront
```

3. Go to `vue-storefront` directory:

```
cd vue-storefront
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

5. Copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json`

:::tip NOTE
We're using the powerful node.js library for config files. Check the docs to learn more about it: [https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)

6. Next [install theme](theme.md)

7. Run Vue Storefront Server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now you should have Vue Storefront running on `localhost:3000`.
