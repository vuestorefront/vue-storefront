::info Open Source integrations use old architecture
Temporarily Open Source integrations use old architecture based on Nuxt 2. We are working closely with their maintainers on updating them to the latest version of Nuxt 3 and Alokai SDK. You can find documentation for the old integrations [here](https://docs.alokai.com/v2). Feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.alokai.com) if you want to learn more.
::

To start new Alokai project simply run our CLI.
```bash
npx @vue-storefront/cli init
```

Our friendly configurator will ask a few questions and set up a fresh Alokai project for you. Your project is a fully-functional eCommerce storefront connected to the eCommerce platform of your choice.
