# Starting new project

## Enterprise Integrations

Most of our integrations are available as part of Alokai Enterprise offering along with Alokai Frontend as A Service Platform. You can learn more or book a demo [here](/enterprise).

## Open Source user

[Some of our eCommerce integrations](/integrations) are available in an Open Source model under MIT licenses. These integrations use Alokai core but are maintained by different companies. 

Even though we closely collaborate with their creators, we cannot provide any support for these integrations as Alokai. When seeking support please use our [Discord Channel](https://discord.alokai.com).

You can find installation instructions for open-source integrations in the respective docs.
