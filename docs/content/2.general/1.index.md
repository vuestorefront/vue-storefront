**We know that use cases leading to eCommerce excellence are often far from standard ones which involves a lot of custom development. On the other hand delivering tailored solutions costs a lot of money, takes a lot of time and involves a lot of risk. At Alokai we want to bridge this gap by providing opinionated and flexible framework for building eCommerce Storefronts.**

Building a storefront requires solving multiple domain-specific problems separately and ensuring these solutions work well together. Itâ€™s not an easy task associated with considerable risk. This is precisely what Alokai was built to help with.

## What is Alokai

Alokai is not just one product. **We provide an ecosystem of independent developer tools** adressing challenges that you will inevitably encounter when building an eCommerce storefront, such as:

::list{type="success"}
- Building a scalable **Design System** with accessible components to keep consistency between different user interface elements.
- Building a fast and reliable **storefront** that delivers excellent User Experience to your customers.
- **Integrating third-party vendors** into your integration layer and storefront.
- **Managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployments** to keep the application fast and reliable even under heavy loads.
- **Implementing engineering and architecture best practices** ensures that the project remains flexible and maintainable even on a large scale.
- **Decoupling frontend from underlying backend systems** so you don't have to reinvest into it every time you update or change some of them.

We will help you with all of the above and more. Our large ecosystem of developer tools and integrations will accelerate and simplify your development process without compromising quality and flexibility.

## Unified Data Layer

In the world of eCommerce, businesses often find themselves shifting between various platforms like commercetools, SAP Commerce Cloud, BigCommerce, and others.

Since each platform has its own unique data structure and APIs, migrating from one platform to another can be a long and error-prone process. The Unified Data Layer can help you solve this challenge by providing standardized data structures and methods that work across multiple platforms.

The Unified Data Layer helps standardize two key aspects of eCommerce applications:

* **Unified Data Model** - standardized data structures for common eCommerce elements
* **Unified Methods** - standardized API calls for eCommerce operations
