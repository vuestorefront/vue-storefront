**We know that use cases leading to eCommerce excellence are often far from standard ones which involves a lot of custom development. On the other hand delivering tailored solutions costs a lot of money, takes a lot of time and involves a lot of risk. At Alokai we want to bridge this gap by providing opinionated and flexible framework for building eCommerce Storefronts.**

Building a storefront requires solving multiple domain-specific problems separately and ensuring these solutions work well together. Itâ€™s not an easy task associated with considerable risk. This is precisely what Alokai was built to help with.

We started in 2017 on Github and we're still true to our Open Source roots. **All of our core products are Open Source** under MIT license. We also have [extended offering for Enterprise customers](/enterprise).

- Building a fast and reliable **storefront** that delivers excellent User Experience to your customers.
- **Integrating third-party vendors** into your API orchestration and storefront.
