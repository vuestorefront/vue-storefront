# Docs

Documentation is at the center of every developer-oriented product. At Alokai, we're always trying to improve on our docs so we can help developers build.

## Where to Find Docs Files

Since the Alokai ecosystem is structured with multiple repositories, this docs site pulls in content from several different sources. 

Typically, you can find the docs' Markdown files for a specific integration/product colocated with the repository that has the actual source code for that repository. 

## How to Contribute

For our open-source repositories, you can add, edit, or fix any docs content by making a Pull Request directly to that repository. Our docs are built on top of Nuxt Content and we have prepared multiple components to create visually-engaging docs. 

You can learn more in our [Writing Guide](/contributing/docs/writing-guide) or the [Docs Theme](/contributing/docs/base-layer) pages.
