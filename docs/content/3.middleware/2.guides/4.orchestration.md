# Orchestration

Orchestration is a powerful way to optimize server requests. This guide will take you through the key aspects of using the orchestration feature, focusing on integrating extensions and how to get the best out of your frontend code.

## The `getApiClient` Method

If you want to retrieve a loaded integration within the context of another, you can use the `getApiClient` method. This method serves as a bridge between various integrations, ensuring seamless data flow and interaction.

Usage:

```javascript
const sapcc = context.getApiClient("sapcc");
```

The `getApiClient` method takes a single argument, which is the key of the api client you wish to retrieve. This is the key you would define in the `middleware.config.js` file for the integration you wish to retrieve. The key is essentially an identifier for the integration.

Here's a basic example of what this might look like:

```javascript
export const integrations = {
  sapcc: {
    location: "@vsf-enterprise/sapcc-api/server",
    configuration: {
      // ...
    },
    extensions: (extensions) => [
      ...extensions,
      {
        name: "sapcc-contentful-extension",
        extendApiMethods: {
          getPDP: async (context, params) => {
            const sapcc = context.getApiClient("sapcc");
            const contentful = context.getApiClient("contentful");

            const [product, content] = Promise.all(
              sapcc.api.getProduct({ id: params.id }),
              contentful.api.getEntries({
                content_type: "product",
                "fields.sku": params.id,
              })
            );

            return {
              product,
              content,
            };
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  contentful: {
    location: "@vue-storefront/contentful-api/server",
    configuration: {
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

## Orchestration for Frontend Optimization

One of the primary advantages of orchestration is the ability to combine multiple requests into a single endpoint. This can drastically reduce the overhead on the frontend, especially in applications where numerous server requests might be initiated simultaneously.

### Benefits:

- Reduced Network Calls: Fewer calls to the server means reduced latency and faster performance.
- Simplified Frontend Logic: Grouping related server requests can help simplify frontend code and logic.
- Consistent Data Retrieval: With orchestration, you can ensure data from multiple integrations is fetched consistently and returned in a unified format.

### Implementation:

1. Extend the integration with new endpoint: Create a new endpoint that will act as the main entry point for the grouped requests.

2. Group Server Requests: Within this endpoint, utilize the `getApiClient` method to retrieve and interact with the required integrations.

3. Aggregate Data: Once data from all required integrations is retrieved, aggregate and format it as needed.

4. Return Unified Response: Send a consolidated response back to the frontend.

Example:

```javascript
export const integrations = {
  sapcc: {
    location: "@vsf-enterprise/sapcc-api/server",
    configuration: {
      // ...
    },
    extensions: (extensions) => [
      ...extensions,
      {
        name: "sapcc-contentful-extension",
        extendApiMethods: {
          getPDP: async (context, params) => {
            const sapcc = context.getApiClient("sapcc");
            const contentful = context.getApiClient("contentful");

            const [product, content] = Promise.all(
              sapcc.api.getProduct({ id: params.id }),
              contentful.api.getEntries({
                content_type: "product",
                "fields.sku": params.id,
              })
            );

            return {
              product,
              content,
            };
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  contentful: {
    location: "@vue-storefront/contentful-api/server",
    configuration: {
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

### Conclusion
Orchestration provides a powerful way to optimize frontend requests, especially in scenarios where multiple integrations need to be queried. By understanding the `getApiClient` method and the associated configuration, developers can create efficient, streamlined solutions for their applications.
