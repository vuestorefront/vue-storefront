# Alokai Customization Guide

Alokai is not a cookie-cutter solution, it is meant to be able to handle even the most complex use cases. This guide will
take you through the most common customization scenarios. We aim to cover end-to-end implementation of realistic
business requirements.

Things you'll do throughout this guide:

* Customize the logo image.
* Adjust the theme colors.
* Implement a pre-header.
* Learn how to implement i18n (internationalization).
* Modify the look and feel of various components.
* Implement a filter search feature.
* Create a new page with a list of brands.
* Implement the "available for pickup" feature - add custom fields to our unified data model.
* Customize the product slug to change the PDP URL.
* Fetch product reviews from an external service.
* Implement a completely new feature from scratch. You will mock a "social product images" feature.
