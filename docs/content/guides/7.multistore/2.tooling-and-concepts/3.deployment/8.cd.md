# Deployment - CD Pipeline

Running deployments on your local machine works great during development, but let's be honest - what we really want is for these processes to happen automatically when we push our code. This guide explains how Continuous Deployment (CD) works in a multistore setup, helping you create an efficient and reliable deployment process that runs without manual intervention.

## Core Concepts

### What is CD in Multistore?

In a multistore setup, CD is designed to:
1. Automatically detect which stores have changed
2. Build and deploy only the changed stores

This targeted approach ensures:
- Faster deployments
- Efficient resource usage
- Less redundancy (unchanged stores are skipped in CD pipeline)

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

The continuous deployment process ensures that your stores are built and deployed efficiently. Here's how it works:

### Deployment Triggers

There are several ways to configure when your stores get deployed:

#### Automatic Deployment
Deploy automatically whenever code is pushed to the main branch:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # Deploy on every push to main
```

#### Manual Deployment
Allow manual deployments with optional store selection:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      store_ids:
        description: 'Space separated list of store IDs to deploy'
        required: false  # When not provided, detect changed stores
```

You can use the automatic deployment for staging and manual deployment for production environment.

::tip Deployment Protection
For Github Actions, you can use deployment protection rules to require manual approval before deployments. Check out the Github [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments) for more details.

### 1. Building and Deploying Stores

The `store deploy` command handles both building and deploying your stores. There's no need to run a separate build step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy stores
    run: |
      yarn store deploy \
        --cloud-username ${{ vars.CLOUD_USERNAME }} \
        --cloud-password ${{ secrets.CLOUD_PASSWORD }} \
        $storeIdsFlag \
        --verbose
```

### 2. Parallel Deployment

For efficient deployment of multiple stores, use a matrix strategy:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        store_id: ${{ fromJson(storeIds) }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy store
        run: |
          yarn store deploy \
            --cloud-username ${{ vars.CLOUD_USERNAME }} \
            --cloud-password ${{ secrets.CLOUD_PASSWORD }} \
            --store-id ${{ matrix.store_id }} \
            --verbose
```

### Understanding Change Detection

The change detection system is a core part of our CI/CD pipeline, implemented in the CLI, with `yarn store changed` command, to ensure consistent behavior across different CI platforms. Here's how it works:

The change detection system analyzes git differences and determines which stores are affected based on several rules:

1. **Root Changes**
   When files in the base applications change (e.g., `/apps/storefront-middleware/src/index.ts`), all stores inheriting from that application are affected, unless they override the changed file.
   
   Example: A change in base middleware:
   - Changed file: `/apps/storefront-middleware/src/index.ts`
   - Affected stores: All stores which don't have their own version of the file

2. **Parent Store Changes**
   When a parent store changes, all its child stores are affected, unless they override the changed file.
   
   Example: A change in parent store:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/fashion-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Affected stores: All stores which don't have their own version of the file

3. **Direct Store Changes**
   When files within a store directory change, only that store is affected.
   
   Example: A change in specific store:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/sports-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Affected store: only `sports-brand`

4. **Dependency Changes**
   Changes to dependency files (e.g., `yarn.lock`) affect all stores.
   
   Example: A change in dependencies:
   - Changed file: `yarn.lock`
   - Affected: All stores

5. **Global Dependencies**
   Changes to globally configured paths (e.g., shared packages) affect all stores. You can mark global dependencies for the `yarn store changed` command by adding the `--global-dependencies` flag. For example:
   ```bash
   # Mark all packages in the packages directory as global dependencies
   yarn store changed --global-dependencies="packages/**"
   ```

6. **File Overrides**
   If a store overrides a file from its parent or base application, changes to the original file won't affect that store.
   
   Example: A file override:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/fashion-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Skipped: `fashion-brand-us` (has its own version of the file)
   - Affected: Other child stores without overrides

The system provides detailed information about why each store was affected:
- `STORE_CHANGED`: Direct changes to the store
- `ANCESTOR_CHANGED`: Changes in parent store or base application
- `PACKAGE_LOCK_CHANGED`: Dependency file changes
- `GLOBAL_DEPENDENCIES_CHANGED`: Changes in globally configured paths

::tip
When debugging why a particular store was affected, run the `yarn store changed` command without the `--condensed` flag to see the detailed change report. You can also run the command locally to debug the changes.

::info Why not use Turbo for change detection?
While Turborepo is great for monorepo task orchestration, it can't handle our dynamic store composition. Our stores are composed into the `.out` directory, which is git-ignored. Turbo relies on git history for change detection, but it can't track how these dynamically composed stores in `.out` directory change. That's why we've implemented our own change detection system that understands store inheritance and file overrides.

### Why Parallel Store Deployments?

We recommend running deployments in parallel (one job per store) for several reasons:

1. **Isolation**
   - Each store deployment runs in its own environment
   - Failures in one store don't affect others
   - Resource limits are per-store, preventing one store from consuming all resources

2. **Performance**
   - Multiple stores deploy simultaneously
   - Overall deployment time is significantly reduced

3. **Maintainability**
   - Easy to retry failed deployments
   - Clear logs per store
   - Simpler debugging and monitoring

### CLI-Driven Approach

Our CI/CD heavily relies on the CLI for several important reasons:

1. **Platform Independence**
   - The same commands work across all platforms
   - No need to rewrite logic for different platforms
   - Consistent behavior everywhere

2. **Local Build and Development Parity**
   - Developers can run the same commands locally
   - Easy to debug CI/CD issues
   - No surprises between local and CI environments

3. **Encapsulated Logic**
   - Complex operations are packaged in simple commands
   - CI configuration focuses on workflow, not implementation
   - Updates to deployment logic don't require CI changes

For example, instead of implementing store change detection in CI:
```yaml
# Don't do this
- name: Detect changes
  run: |
    # Complex git diff logic
    # Parse file paths
    # Check store inheritance
    # Handle overrides
```

We use a single CLI command:
```yaml
# Do this instead
- name: Detect changes
  run: yarn store changed --since $SINCE_SHA --to $TO_SHA
```

This approach makes it easy to implement our CI/CD pipeline in any CI system that can run shell commands.
