# Development - Using a local environment

This guide explains how to set up and run your local development environment for Alokai multistore projects, building on the concepts of file-based inheritance.

## Root Scripts

Let's start with the foundation of your development workflow. Alokai provides essential scripts that will help you develop, test, and deploy your stores efficiently. These scripts are available in your project root's `package.json` and form the basis of your daily development tasks:

- `dev`: Your go-to command for development - starts all your stores in development mode with hot-reload
- `build`: Prepares your stores for production with optimized builds
- `start`: Runs your production build locally to verify everything works as expected
- `test:integration:pw`: Ensures your stores work correctly by running integration tests
- `store`: An alias for the `./node_modules/.bin/alokai-cli store`. You can use it to run any `alokai-cli store` command.

:::info Scripts are shortcuts for `alokai-cli` commands
All of these commands use the `@alokai/cli` underneath. For instance, the `dev` command is just a shortcut for `./node_modules/.bin/alokai-cli store dev --all --verbose`.
:::

:::warning Using Alokai CLI
All store management operations must be performed through the Alokai CLI. Native Next.js/Nuxt commands will not work correctly with the multistore setup, as they don't handle the inheritance and configuration requirements of Alokai stores.
:::

## Starting Local Development

The most common way to start development is using the yarn scripts from the root level:

```bash
# Start development mode for all stores
yarn dev

# Start development for a specific store
yarn store dev --store-id=my-store
# Alternatively, you may use: ./node_modules/.bin/alokai-cli store dev --store-id=my-store
```

The `dev` command watches for changes in:
- The current store's files
- Parent stores in the inheritance chain
- Base applications (`apps/storefront-unified-nextjs`, etc.)

When a file changes, the CLI automatically:
1. Detects which stores are affected by the change
2. Moves the affected files to the `.out` directory, so the app's framework can hot-reload the changes

::alert{type="info"}
The applications will run on ports specified in the `alokai.config.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "stores": {
    "default": {
      "localPorts": {
        "middleware": 4000,
        "nextjs": 3000,
        "nuxt": 3333
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each store can have its own port configuration to avoid conflicts when running multiple stores simultaneously.

### Using Local Domains

Alokai uses Caddy as a reverse proxy to handle local domains. The Caddyfile is automatically generated based on the `alokai.config.json` file and the `localDomain` property for each store.

#### Prerequisites

- [Caddy server installed](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
- Local domains configured in your hosts file. For example:
  - If you have a store with `localDomain` set to `default.local`, add `127.0.0.1 default.local` to your hosts file

#### Starting with local domains

Start all stores with their local domains:

```bash
yarn store dev --all --with-local-domains
```

:::tip HTTPS
Caddy automatically generates self-signed SSL certificates for local domains. You
can read more about it in the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).
:::

## Building for Production

To test the production build locally:

1. Build all deployable stores:
```bash
yarn build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
yarn start
```

Note that template stores are not built into the `.out` directory, as they only serve as templates for their descendant stores.

## Running Integration Tests

Integration tests run against the composed stores, respecting the file inheritance chain:

```bash
yarn test:integration:pw
```

You can also run tests in Playwright's UI mode for better debugging experience:

```bash
yarn store test --store-id=my-store --ui
```

:::warning
The `--ui` flag only works when testing a single store. Make sure to specify the store using the `--store-id` flag.
:::

For more information on integration tests, refer to the [Integration Tests](/guides/multistore/tooling-and-concepts/development/integration-tests) guide.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Cache Problems

If you experience unexpected behavior with file inheritance or turbo cache. For example:
- You modify a component in your store, but the changes are not reflected in the browser
- The `.out` directory still contains old versions of your files after making changes

Here's how to fix it:

```bash
# Clear Turbo cache
rm -rf .turbo/cache

# Clear composed store outputs
rm -rf .out/*

# Rebuild all stores
yarn build
```

::alert{type="warning"}
The `.out` directory contains the composed stores and is in `.gitignore`. If you experience inheritance issues, try clearing this directory and rebuilding.

## Development Best Practices

1. **Use Store-Specific Development**
When working on a single store, use the `--store-id` flag to improve build times:
```bash
yarn store dev --store-id=my-store
```

2. **Test Inheritance Chain**
When modifying shared code, test all affected stores:
```bash
# See which stores are affected by current changes
yarn store changed

# Build and test affected stores
yarn store build --store-id=affected-store-id-1,affected-store-id-2
```

:::tip
In the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, the affected stores are built and tested automatically. You can read more about it in the [CD Pipeline](/guides/multistore/tooling-and-concepts/deployment/cd) guide.
:::

1. **Debugging Inheritance**
Use the `--verbose` flag to see detailed file resolution:
```bash
yarn store build --store-id=my-store --verbose
```
You can also use the `DEBUG=*` environment variable to get even more logs:
```bash
DEBUG=* yarn store build --store-id=my-store
```

1. **Inspect Store Composition**
Examine how stores are composed in the `.out` directory:
```bash
yarn store build --store-id=my-store --compose-only
```
This will skip the build and only compose the store into the `.out` directory.
