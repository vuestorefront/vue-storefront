# Introduction

Alokai Cloud customers' middleware and frontend apps are deployed in Kubernetes. This document explains the Kubernetes mechanisms used by Alokai Cloud to ensure that customers' applications are starting, running and exiting correctly. Implementing your application so that it works in accordance with those mechanisms ensures better detectability of issues and lower error rates of your deployment.

In order for some of those mechanisms to work, you - as the application developer - need to ensure certain REST endpoints exist in your application and that they respond with the correct status code. The sections below explain how to implement those endpoints.
