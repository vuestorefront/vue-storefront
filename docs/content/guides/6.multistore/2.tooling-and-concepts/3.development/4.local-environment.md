# Development - Using a local environment

This guide explains how to set up and run your local development environment for Alokai multistore projects, building on the concepts of file-based inheritance.

## Root Scripts

During the development process, you will likely use the following scripts from the project root:
- `dev`: Starts development mode for all stores
- `build`: Creates production build for direct stores
- `start`: Runs production build locally
- `test:integration:pw`: Runs integration tests with Playwright

## Starting Local Development

The most common way to start development is using the yarn scripts from the root level:

```bash
# Start development mode for all stores
yarn dev

# Start development for a specific store
yarn store dev --store-id=my-store
```

The `dev` command watches for changes in:
- The current store's files
- Parent stores in the inheritance chain
- Base applications (`apps/storefront-unified-nextjs`, etc.)

When a file changes, the CLI automatically:
1. Detects which stores are affected by the change
2. Moves the affected files to the `.out` directory, so the app's framework can hot-reload the changes

::alert{type="info"}
The applications will run on ports specified in the `alokai.config.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "stores": {
    "default": {
      "localPorts": {
        "middleware": 4000,
        "nextjs": 3000,
        "nuxt": 3333
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each store can have its own port configuration to avoid conflicts when running multiple stores simultaneously.

### Using Local Domains

Alokai uses Caddy as a reverse proxy to handle local domains. The Caddyfile is automatically generated based on the `alokai.config.json` file and the `localDomain` property for each store.

#### Prerequisites

- [Caddy server installed](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
- Local domains configured in your hosts file. For example:
  - If you have a store with `localDomain` set to `default.local`, add `127.0.0.1 default.local` to your hosts file

#### Starting with local domains

Start all stores with their local domains:

```bash
yarn store dev --all --with-local-domains
```

:::tip HTTPS
Caddy automatically generates self-signed SSL certificates for local domains. You 
can read more about it in the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).

## Building for Production

To test the production build locally:

1. Build all direct stores:
```bash
yarn build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
yarn start
```

Note that inheritance-only stores are not built into the `.out` directory, as they only serve as templates for their descendant stores.

## Running Integration Tests

Integration tests run against the composed stores, respecting the file inheritance chain:

```bash
yarn test:integration:pw
```

For more information on integration tests, refer to the [Integration Tests](/guides/multistore/tooling-and-concepts/development/local-environment) guide.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Cache Problems

If you experience unexpected behavior with file inheritance or turbo cache:

```bash
# Clear Turbo cache
rm -rf .turbo/cache

# Clear composed store outputs
rm -rf .out/*

# Rebuild all stores
yarn build
```

::alert{type="warning"}
The `.out` directory contains the composed stores and is in `.gitignore`. If you experience inheritance issues, try clearing this directory and rebuilding.

## Development Best Practices

1. **Use Store-Specific Development**
When working on a single store, use the `--store-id` flag to improve build times:
```bash
yarn store dev --store-id=my-store
```

2. **Test Inheritance Chain**
When modifying shared code, test all affected stores:
```bash
# See which stores are affected by current changes
yarn store changed

# Build and test affected stores
yarn store build --store-id=affected-store-id-1,affected-store-id-2
```

:::tip
In the Continuous Integration pipeline, the affected stores are built and tested automatically. You can read more about it in the [Continuous Integration](/guides/multistore/tooling-and-concepts/deployment/ci-cd) guide.

3. **Debugging Inheritance**
Use the `--verbose` flag to see detailed file resolution:
```bash
yarn store build --store-id=my-store --verbose
```
You can also use the `DEBUG=*` environment variable to get even more logs:
```bash
DEBUG=* yarn store build --store-id=my-store
```

4. **Inspect Store Composition**
Examine how stores are composed in the `.out` directory:
```bash
yarn store build --store-id=my-store --compose-only
```
This will skip the build and only compose the store into the `.out` directory.
