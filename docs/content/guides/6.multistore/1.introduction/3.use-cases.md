# Use cases

## Scaling to new touchpoints

Expanding to new touchpoints—mobile apps, marketplaces, in-store kiosks—seems like a logical step to reach more customers. However, without a unified approach, each addition introduces inefficiencies and fragmentation.

Take a retailer that starts with an online store and later launches a mobile app, an in-store kiosk, and integrates with third-party marketplaces. Each of these requires separate development, unique integrations, and individual maintenance. A simple feature update, like a new product recommendation engine, must be implemented separately across multiple platforms, leading to inconsistencies and slow rollouts. The website may get the feature first, while the mobile app lags behind due to separate deployment cycles, and the kiosk might not support it at all.

This disjointed approach also impacts debugging. A bug in a checkout flow might behave differently across platforms, forcing teams to troubleshoot in silos. Meanwhile, managing real-time inventory, pricing, and user sessions across these disconnected systems becomes increasingly difficult, leading to performance issues and degraded customer experiences.

Without a scalable, unified strategy, companies struggle with inefficiencies, longer time-to-market, and rising operational costs. Instead of focusing on growth, they are stuck managing an overly complex and fragmented infrastructure.
