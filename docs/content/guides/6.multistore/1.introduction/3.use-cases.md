# Use Cases

-  No matter if it's a different geography, touchpoint or even a completely different brand, -  Most of the eCommerce applications share 60-80% functional. The goal of Alokai is to provide you with a setup that is as efficient as possible and ensures that the common piece is reused, not duplicated and maintained separately. This is easy to maintain and grow.

## Scaling to New Touchpoints

Expanding to new touchpoints—mobile apps, marketplaces, in-store kiosks—introduces unexpected complexities that can slow down innovation and increase operational burdens.

- **Inconsistent Feature Rollouts** – Each touchpoint often requires separate development, meaning that new features must be built and deployed multiple times. A product recommendation engine, for example, might launch on the website first, take weeks to arrive on mobile, and never make it to in-store kiosks due to technical constraints.
- **Fragmented Development and Maintenance** – Every platform comes with its own technical stack, integration requirements, and release cycles. Maintaining consistency across them requires redundant effort, slowing down iteration and increasing costs.
- **Difficult Debugging and Troubleshooting** – Bugs behave differently across touchpoints. A checkout issue might occur only in the mobile app but not on the website, forcing teams to debug and fix problems separately rather than solving them in one place.
- **Performance and Data Synchronization Issues** – Real-time inventory updates, pricing changes, and user sessions need to be in sync across all touchpoints. Without a centralized approach, discrepancies arise, leading to poor customer experiences.

Without a unified system, businesses struggle with inefficiencies, delayed feature releases, and higher maintenance costs. Instead of focusing on growth and innovation, they get bogged down in managing a fragmented ecosystem of loosely connected storefronts.

### How Alokai solves it?

-  Most of the applications share 80% functionalities and differentiate only in details. Unify as much as possible, reuse same pieces of the software in other touchpoint and differentiete only where the touchpoints are really different - frontend layer.
- 
- Unify the frontend layer technology - JavaScript, contrary to using web technologies, java, Objective-C etc. This allows to have a single team and a single codebase where functionalities can be easily shared between different touchpoints.

## Expanding into New Geographies

Expanding into new geographies introduces additional layers of complexity that often lead businesses to launch separate storefronts per region. These challenges arise from the need to accommodate region-specific requirements and operational differences:

- **Localized Vendor and Payment Providers** – Different regions require different payment gateways, logistics partners, and tax compliance setups. Integrating each separately leads to redundant systems and inefficiencies.
- **Localized UI and UX Adjustments** – Languages, currencies, date formats, and even browsing behaviors differ across geographies. Without a flexible system, businesses are forced to create region-specific versions of their applications.
- **Infrastructure and Performance Issues** – Serving customers in different regions from a single data center leads to slow load times. Without a distributed hosting strategy, performance degrades significantly.

Due to these challenges, many businesses resort to launching separate eCommerce platforms for each region, leading to a fragmented ecosystem that is hard to maintain. Over time, this lack of centralization makes rolling out global updates slow and expensive, ultimately limiting scalability and agility.

## Launching New Brands

Scaling to New Brands

As companies grow, they often expand their brand portfolio through acquisitions. While this can drive business growth, it also introduces significant technical and operational challenges that impact scalability and efficiency.

Diverse eCommerce Setups – Each acquired brand often comes with its own eCommerce platform, vendor relationships, and technology stack. Managing multiple independent systems creates redundancies and makes maintenance cumbersome.

Inconsistent Vendor and Payment Systems – Different brands may use different payment gateways, logistics providers, and tax compliance tools, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs.

Fragmented Teams and Workflows – Acquired brands often retain their own development teams, workflows, and release cycles. Without a unified strategy, collaboration becomes difficult, slowing down feature development and increasing technical debt.

Higher Infrastructure and Maintenance Costs – Running multiple separate platforms instead of a centralized system results in duplicated costs for hosting, integrations, and support.

Over time, managing multiple standalone eCommerce platforms reduces business agility and makes global scaling inefficient. Instead of leveraging shared resources and streamlined workflows, companies end up managing disconnected systems that hinder innovation and increase operational complexity.
