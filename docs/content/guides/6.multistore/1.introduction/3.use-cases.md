# Use cases

**Scaling to new touchpoints**

Expanding to new touchpoints—mobile apps, marketplaces, in-store kiosks—introduces unexpected complexities that can slow down innovation and increase operational burdens.

- **Inconsistent Feature Rollouts** – Each touchpoint often requires separate development, meaning that new features must be built and deployed multiple times. A product recommendation engine, for example, might launch on the website first, take weeks to arrive on mobile, and never make it to in-store kiosks due to technical constraints.
- **Fragmented Development and Maintenance** – Every platform comes with its own technical stack, integration requirements, and release cycles. Maintaining consistency across them requires redundant effort, slowing down iteration and increasing costs.
- **Difficult Debugging and Troubleshooting** – Bugs behave differently across touchpoints. A checkout issue might occur only in the mobile app but not on the website, forcing teams to debug and fix problems separately rather than solving them in one place.
- **Performance and Data Synchronization Issues** – Real-time inventory updates, pricing changes, and user sessions need to be in sync across all touchpoints. Without a centralized approach, discrepancies arise, leading to poor customer experiences.

Without a unified system, businesses struggle with inefficiencies, delayed feature releases, and higher maintenance costs. Instead of focusing on growth and innovation, they get bogged down in managing a fragmented ecosystem of loosely connected storefronts.

**Expanding into New Geographies**

Expanding into new geographies introduces additional layers of complexity that often lead businesses to launch separate storefronts per region. These challenges arise from the need to accommodate region-specific requirements and operational differences:

- **Localized Vendor and Payment Providers** – Different regions require different payment gateways, logistics partners, and tax compliance setups. Integrating each separately leads to redundant systems and inefficiencies.
- **Localized UI and UX Adjustments** – Languages, currencies, date formats, and even browsing behaviors differ across geographies. Without a flexible system, businesses are forced to create region-specific versions of their applications.
- **Infrastructure and Performance Issues** – Serving customers in different regions from a single data center leads to slow load times. Without a distributed hosting strategy, performance degrades significantly.

Due to these challenges, many businesses resort to launching separate eCommerce platforms for each region, leading to a fragmented ecosystem that is hard to maintain. Over time, this lack of centralization makes rolling out global updates slow and expensive, ultimately limiting scalability and agility.
