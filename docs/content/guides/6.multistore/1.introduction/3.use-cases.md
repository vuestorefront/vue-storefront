# Use Cases

While this reusability mechanism is universal, we described some of the most common cases where an efficient eCommerce setup can be a transformative value for your business.

## Scaling to New Touchpoints

Expanding to new touchpoints—mobile apps, marketplaces, in-store kiosks—introduces unexpected complexities that can slow down innovation and increase operational burdens.

- **Inconsistent Feature Rollouts** – Each touchpoint often requires separate development, meaning that new features must be built and deployed multiple times. A product recommendation engine, for example, might launch on the website first, take weeks to arrive on mobile, and never make it to in-store kiosks due to technical constraints.
- **Fragmented Development and Maintenance** – Every platform comes with its own technical stack, integration requirements, and release cycles. Maintaining consistency across them requires redundant effort, slowing down iteration and increasing costs.
- **Difficult Debugging and Troubleshooting** – Bugs behave differently across touchpoints. A checkout issue might occur only in the mobile app but not on the website, forcing teams to debug and fix problems separately rather than solving them in one place.
- **Performance and Data Synchronization Issues** – Real-time inventory updates, pricing changes, and user sessions need to be in sync across all touchpoints. Without a centralized approach, discrepancies arise, leading to poor customer experiences.

Without a unified system, businesses struggle with inefficiencies, delayed feature releases, and higher maintenance costs. **Instead of focusing on growth and innovation, they get bogged down in managing a fragmented ecosystem of loosely connected storefronts.**

### How Alokai solves it?

- **Unified tech stack and single codebase** allows you to **write the business logic and major part of the UI logic once, and use it for every touchpoint without repeating the code**. All of the touchpoints are maintained by one team. 

- **Rolling a new touchpoint can now be done within days.** Simply create a new directory, iherit all the functionalities and override the parts of the UI that differentiate. For mobile apps, you can leverage hybrid solutions like React Native and reuse most of the web storefornt code. 

- **Forget about api orchestration and federation madness.** Alokai Connect will serve as a central source of data shared across all your frontends - no matter if it's a web storefront, mobile app, kiosk or anything else. In addition, it unifies the data of all systems into a common format to take reusability to the extreme level.


## Expanding into New Geographies

Expanding into new geographies introduces additional layers of complexity that often lead businesses to launch separate storefronts per region. These challenges arise from the need to accommodate region-specific requirements and operational differences:

- **Localized Vendor and Payment Providers** – Different regions require different payment gateways, logistics partners, and tax compliance setups. Integrating each separately leads to redundant systems and inefficiencies.
- **Localized UI and UX Adjustments** – Languages, currencies, date formats, and even browsing behaviors differ across geographies. Without a flexible system, businesses are forced to create region-specific versions of their applications.
- **Infrastructure and Performance Issues** – Serving customers in different regions from a single data center leads to slow load times. Without a distributed hosting strategy, performance degrades significantly.

Due to these challenges, many businesses resort to launching separate eCommerce platforms for each region, leading to a fragmented ecosystem that is hard to maintain. Over time, this lack of centralization makes rolling out global updates slow and expensive, ultimately limiting scalability and agility.

## Launching New Brands

As companies grow, they often expand their brand portfolio through acquisitions. While this can drive business growth, it also introduces significant technical and operational challenges that impact scalability and efficiency.

**Diverse eCommerce Setups** – Each acquired brand often comes with its own eCommerce platform, vendor relationships, and technology stack. Managing multiple independent systems creates redundancies and makes maintenance cumbersome.

**Inconsistent Vendor and Payment Systems** – Different brands may use different payment gateways, logistics providers, and tax compliance tools, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs.

**Fragmented Teams and Workflows** – Acquired brands often retain their own development teams, workflows, and release cycles. Without a unified strategy, collaboration becomes difficult, slowing down feature development and increasing technical debt.

**Higher Infrastructure and Maintenance Costs** – Running multiple separate platforms instead of a centralized system results in duplicated costs for hosting, integrations, and support.

Over time, managing multiple standalone eCommerce platforms reduces business agility and makes global scaling inefficient. Instead of leveraging shared resources and streamlined workflows, companies end up managing disconnected systems that hinder innovation and increase operational complexity.



## Simplifying complex setups stage-by-stage

Scaling in any of the above dimensions is not easy and usually results in a lot of technical debt.

The reason why many companies decide to start froms cratch at some point is because it's really ahrd to get out of it when it reaches a certain scale. High number of technologies and variations makes it almost impossible.
At Alokai, we're an experts in breaking complex cases down into simpler, easily achievable steps. This way you can focus on solving the most pressing problems that will provide highest ROI first and see tanglible results within a shortest possible timeframe. For tech teams, this is icnreadibly improtant as it allows them to win the trust of business stakehodlers and get a green light for further changes.

Every project is unique and has it's own challenges. We've seen enough of them to know what works and what doesn't so we can tailor the startegy specifically to your needs.
