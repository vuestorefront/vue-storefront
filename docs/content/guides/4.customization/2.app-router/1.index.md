# Alokai Customization Guide

Alokai is not a cookie-cutter solution, it is meant to be able to handle even the most complex use cases. This guide will take you through the most common customization scenarios. We aim to cover end-to-end implementation of realistic business requirements.

Some of the customizations you'll do throughout this guide are:
