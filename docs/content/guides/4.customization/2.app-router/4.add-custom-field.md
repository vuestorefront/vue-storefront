# Adding custom fields to the Unified Data Model / Implementing "Available for pickup" feature

It's a common case to enrich the default data models with custom fields.

In this chapter, you will learn:

::list{type="success"}
- how to add a custom field to the unified product data model in the middleware
- how to utilize that field in the storefront
::

By adding a "pickup availability" feature.

![Available for pickup](./images/available-for-pickup.webp)

1. Open `apps/storefront-middleware/integrations/sapcc/extensions/unified.ts` file and modify the code accordingly:

```diff [apps/storefront-middleware/integrations/sapcc/extensions/unified.ts]
export const unifiedApiExtension = createUnifiedExtension({
  normalizers: {
    addCustomFields: [
+      {
+        normalizeProduct(context, input) {
+          return {
+            availableForPickup: input.availableForPickup,
+          };
+        },
+      },
    ],
  },
```

Within `addCustomFields`, we extend the normalizer functions. We take the raw input (coming from eCommerce) and have to
return a set of custom fields.

::

2. Now, `availableForPickup` field should be available in the front end, so let's use it. Replace the hardcoded placeholder
in the `PurchaseCard` component:


```diff [apps/storefront-unified-nextjs/components/purchase-card.tsx]
-        {t.rich('additionalInfo.pickup', {
-          link: (chunks) => (
-            <SfLink href="#" variant="secondary">
-              {chunks}
-            </SfLink>
-          ),
-        })}
+  <p>Pickup {product.$custom?.availableForPickup ? '' : 'not'} available</p>
```

And that's it. You can find a complete project example in this repository: <https://github.com/vsf-customer/extensibility-demo-v2>
