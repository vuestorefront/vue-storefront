# Alokai Next.js Guide

Welcome to the Alokai Next.js guide. This guide will help you get started with building your first Alokai application from the ground up.

This guide is designed to help you get started with Alokai and provide you with the knowledge you need to build your first Alokai x Next.js application. We will cover everything from creating a new Alokai project to building a simple application that uses the Alokai products.

## What You Will Learn

- How to create a new Alokai project
- How to build a simple Alokai application
- How to use the Alokai products

## Framework of Choice

This guide will focus on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the frontend framework of choice. Next.js is a popular React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered applications. It is a great choice for building Alokai applications because it is easy to use and has a large community of developers.

Alokai, thanks to its modular [Architecture](/general/basics/architecture), can be used with any frontend framework.
If you are interested in using Alokai with other frontend frameworks, check out our [guides](/guides) section for more information.

Alokai comes in two editions: Enterprise and Open Source. This guide will focus on the Enterprise edition, but the same principles apply to the Open Source edition.

You can find all available Alokai integrations in the [integrations](/integrations) section.
