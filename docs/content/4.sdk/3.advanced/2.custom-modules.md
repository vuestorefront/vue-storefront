# Custom modules

::: tip When is a custom module necessary?
Many times, the default `middlewareModule` is enough to handle the communication with the Server Middleware. You can achieve customizing the behavior and logic of the endpoints by [extending the module](sdk/advanced/extending-module). 

However, you may need to create a module that doesn't communicate with the Server Middleware at all. For example, a logger module, or a module that is communicating with a third-party service directly and needs to run on the frontend. In this case, a custom module is the way to go.
:::

## Module

Let's start with the module itself. The module is a function that implements the `Module` interface.
Frist, create a new directory `sdk/modules/logger`. Then, navigate to it and create a new file `module.ts` with the following code:

```typescript
import { Module } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";

export const loggerModule = () => {
  return {
    connector: {},
    utils: {},
    subscribers: {},
  } satisfies Module;
};
```

The `connector`, `utils`, and `subscribers` are the parts of the module. The `connector` is the part that is responsible for the module's methods. The `utils` are the helper functions that can be used in the module. The `subscribers` are the functions that are called when the event is emitted.

## Connector

The connector is the part of the module that is responsible for the module's methods. The connector is an object that contains the methods.

```typescript [module.ts]
import { Module } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";

export const loggerModule = () => {
  return {
    connector: {
      log: (message: string) => {
        console.log(message);
      },
    },
    utils: {},
    subscribers: {},
  } satisfies Module;
};
```

You can also separate the connector into a separate file. Create a new file `connector.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript [connector.ts]
import { Connector } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";

export const loggerConnector = () => {
  return {
    log: (message: string) => {
      console.log(message);
    },
  } satisfies Connector;
};
```

Now, the logger connector is in a separate file and can be used in the module.

```typescript [module.ts]
import { Module } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";
import { loggerConnector } from "./connector";

export const loggerModule = () => {
  return {
    connector: loggerConnector(),
    utils: {},
    subscribers: {},
  } satisfies Module;
};
```

## Methods

To keep the connector clean, you can separate the methods into a separate file. Create a new file `methods.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript [methods.ts]
export const log = (message: string) => {
  console.log(message);
};
```

Now, you can use the `log` method in the connector.

```typescript [connector.ts]
import { Connector } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";
import * as methods from "./methods";

export const loggerConnector = () => {
  return {
    ...methods,
  } satisfies Connector;
};
```

Let's also make the methods more complex by extending their functionality. Let's assume that we want to log the message to the server as well.

```typescript [methods.ts]
export const log = (message: string) => {
  console.log(message);
  fetch("https://example.com/log", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ message }),
  });
};
```

Now, the `log` method is logging the message to the console and sending it to the server.

## Utils

Utils are the helper functions that can be helpful when working with the module. For example, you can create a helper function that is adding a timestamp.

```typescript [module.ts]
import { Module } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";
import { loggerConnector } from "./connector";

export const loggerModule = () => {
  return {
    connector: loggerConnector(),
    utils: {
      formatMessage: (message: string) => {
        return `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}`;
      },
    },
    subscribers: {},
  } satisfies Module;
};
```

## Subscribers

Subscribers are the functions that are called when the event is emitted. For example, you can create a subscriber that is logging the message to the server.
You can learn more about the subscribers in the [Subscribers](/sdk/advanced/extending-module#subscribers) docs.

```typescript [module.ts]
import { Module } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";
import { loggerConnector } from "./connector";

export const loggerModule = () => {
  return {
    connector: loggerConnector(),
    utils: {
      formatMessage: (message: string) => {
        return `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}`;
      },
    },
    subscribers: {
      "*_after": (payload) => {
        fetch("https://example.com/log", {
          method: "POST",
          body: JSON.stringify(payload),
        });
      },
    },
  } satisfies Module;
};
```

Now, the subscriber is logging the payload to the server after every method call of every SDK module.

Finally, you can use the module in your application.

```typescript
import { initSdk, buildModule } from "@vue-storefront/sdk";
import { loggerModule } from "./module";

const sdk = initSdk({
  logger: buildModule(loggerModule),
});

sdk.utils.formatMessage(sdk.logger.log("Hello, World!")); // 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z - Hello, World!
```
