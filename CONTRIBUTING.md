## Issue reporting guidelines:

Always define type of issue:
* Bug report
* Feature request

While writing issues, be as specific as possible
All requests regarding support with implementation or application setup should be sent to contributors@vuestorefront.io

Here’s how to submit a pull request:

# Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local repository to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote repository. Pull in changes from “upstream” often in order to stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
# Create a branch for your edits. Use the following branch naming conventions:
## bugfix/task-title
## feature/task-name
# Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (ex. “OLOY: 39. Issue title.”).
# Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
# Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests and create new ones when needed. Make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.

If you have found a potential security vulnerability, please DO NOT report it on the public issue tracker. Instead, send it to us at contributors@vuestorefront.io. We will work with you to verify and fix it as soon as possible.
