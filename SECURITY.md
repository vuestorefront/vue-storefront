# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not publicly disclose potential security vulnerabilities. Instead, report them to our dedicated email address security@vuestorefront.io. This will allow us to quickly determine the severity of the problem and provide a fix without putting existing projects at risk
