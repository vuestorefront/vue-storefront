## Join the community on Slack

If you have any questions or ideas feel free to join our slack via invitation link: [https://slack.vuestorefront.io/](https://slack.vuestorefront.io/)

## Roadmap

[Here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/milestones) you can find the accepted roadmap for current milestone and what you can expect with next release.

#### Roadmap planning
[Here](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/projects/3) you can vote for feature requests and see which ones were accepted. The most upvoted ones will be added to the next milestones. You can also join the slack channel `#roadmap-planning` where we discuss the next milestones.

The process of adding new features to the roadmap looks like this:
1. You create an issue and label it as `feature request`.
2. One of VS Core team verifies the feature request and if the explanation is clear, it is added to the `Roadmap` project so it's visible in the board.
3. Now people can vote for this feature to be added into next milestone with `thumb up` emoji.
4. Feature requests with the biggest popularity will be added into next milestones.

We are planning 1-2 milestones ahead. Our milestones are based on requirements from community, partners and production implementations.

Please note that bugfixes are treated separately and in most cases added to the milestones immediately.



[Check the feature list of 1.0](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/feature-list.html).

## The business challenges

Vue Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal for the application is to provide the solution with:

- The ultrafast front-end for the store - with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
- The endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
- The off-line shopping capabilities;
- The smooth shopping experience close to the user experience from the native mobile applications;
- The all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile screens with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
- Rapid development without architecture limitations.

## The technology

Vue Storefront was built as an all-in-one front-end for eCommerce. For providing the best performance we decided to use Vue.js as a front-end library, Node.js + Express (and maybe GraphQL support) as a server-API, Elastic Search as a database of products and full PWA/off-line support.
Here you can read more about the proof of concept for [Vue Storefront connected with Magento2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magento2-nosql-database-pwa-support-piotr-karwatka).

Besides a big improvement for the shopping experience, we also want to create a great code base for every developer who needs to work on a front-end application for the eCommerce.

## The headless architecture

![Vue Storefront - Headless Architecture](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e7cf661c23ac9df156d9c3d/5eff4a2497a1546ca057dcca_github_headless_architecture.png)

## Design

Vue Storefront supports by default **two different themes:**
1. **[Capybara Theme based on Storefront UI](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vsf-capybara)**

<img alt="Vue Storefront - Capybara Theme" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e7cf661c23ac9df156d9c3d/5eff49534dba189aafa21e55_Github_Capybara_Theme.jpg">

 
2. **[Classic/Default ](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vsf-default)**

The application is prepared to be fully customized in design through the theming system.
With the current version we work on raw, basic template of typical eCommerce for a fashion industry. In the project we used [Material Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

<img width="880" alt="Vue Storefront - Annimations in sidebar menu" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18116406/33559404-ed674bcc-d90c-11e7-864a-91e42d1c92cd.gif">

Here you can read more about the process of [designing PWA for eCommerce](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designing-pwa-ecommerce-karl-bzik/).

The design is available in open source in the Figma file format under the URL https://www.figma.com/file/VKyqbHFI55TKIKcQlFLiVpVF/Vue-Storefront-Open-Source.

## Concerns when hosting
When hosting NodeJS applications there are some differences compared to, for example, hosting PHP or Java applications.
Server Side Rendering via NodeJS can have memory leaks because of suboptimal code. Although core code is optimized, project specific features or misaligned hosting configuration can introduce this. More on how to avoid these for VueJS can be ready in [this article](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/avoiding-memory-leaks.html). We also recommend reading about [VueJS best practices](https://blog.usejournal.com/vue-js-best-practices-c5da8d7af48d).

 On the server we advice to run [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) which offers features to keep your NodeJS application stable. When hosting on Kubernetes the checks and memory limits can be leveraged to kill unhealthy containers.
More on hosting can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/installation/production-setup.html#production-setup-bare-vps).

## Other platforms
Vue Storefront is platform agnostic which means it can be connected to virtually any CMS. Please take a look at [Pimcore bridge](https://github.com/vuestorefront/coreshop-vsbridge) to give you an idea of how other platforms can be connected. Any support for integrating Prestashop, Shopify ... - much appreciated.
