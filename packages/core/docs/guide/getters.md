# Getters

> The getters are closely connected to the composables. If you are not already familiar with the concept, please refer to the composables chapter first.

## What are getters?

Getters are functions that are used to get the data from the raw API responses. They return an agnostic or a primitive types and allow you to write the same code regardless of the backend used.
Each composable has its own dedicated getter, e.g. `useCart` and `cartGetters`. **You should only use getters dedicated to specific composable**.

## When should I use them?

**Getters should be used whenever possible to extract the data from composables**, e.g., when you want to get the quantity of the products in the cart in UI components.

## How can I use getters?

The getters accept arguments to get the data. As an example, we will use cart functionalities.
Most functions in `cartGetters` accept whole `cart` object or individual cart items. This data needs to be extracted from `useCart` composable first.
As the first example, we will use `getTotalItems` from `cartGetters` to get the total number of items in the cart.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- ... -->
    <span>
      {{ cartTotalItems }}
    </span>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { computed } from '@vue/composition-api';
import { useCart, cartGetters } from '{INTEGRATION}';
import { onSSR } from '@vue-storefront/core';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { cart, load } = useCart();
    const cartTotalItems = computed(() => cartGetters.getTotalItems(cart.value);

    onSSR(async () => {
      await load();
    });

    return {
      cart,
      cartTotalItems,
    };
  }
}
</script>
```

**It's important to use getters as the computed property** to have them always updated:

```vue
<script>
  import {  cartGetters } from '{INTEGRATION}';
  export default {
    setup() {
    
     // Don't do this, because you lose reactivity
      const nonReactive = cartGetters.getTotalItems(cart.value);
      
      // Do this instead
       const reactive = computed(() => cartGetters.getTotalItems(cart.value);
    };
  }
</script>
```
