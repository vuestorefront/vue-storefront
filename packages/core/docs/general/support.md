# Support

## How to get help?

Feel invited to join our community at [Discord](http://discord.vuestorefront.io/) - this is the place, where you can ask your questions, start interesting discussions, and meet Vue Storefront Core Team Members.

Check out our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VueStorefront) to get the latest news and announcements.

## How to ask for help?

First, check our docs page - your answer may be already available there. Use the search feature - this will allow you to find specific sections quickly. While submitting a bug or feature request, search for possible duplicates - there is no reason to open a new issue when a similar one already exists.

When possible, try to provide all the necessary information to reproduce the issue. If you encounter difficulties while following docs guides - always add links to specific pages/sections. Attach relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots to make your question easier to answer.

## Found an Issue?

If you would like to submit a bug or have a feature suggestion, visit our project [GitHub page](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront) and create an issue.
