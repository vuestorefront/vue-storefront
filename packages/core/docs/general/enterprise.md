# What is Vue Storefront Enterprise

> Vue Storefront Enterprise is currently available only for commercetools

Vue Storefront Enterprise is a commercial offering from the Vue Storefront core team built on top of the open-source product. Its goal is to give you all the tools you need to launch your shop and provide you with ready-to-use integrations that will reduce your project's development time and cost.

## Differences between Open Source and Enterprise versions

In Enterprise Edition you're getting everything that's in our open-source version. On top of that, we also provide:

- access to [Vue Storefront Cloud](https://www.vuestorefront.io/cloud);
- additional [integrations](/v2/integrations) with third-party services;
- extended integration with eCommerce platform with advanced features.

Everything with <Badge text="Enterprise" type="info" /> badge in the documentation is only available for our Enterprise customers.

You can learn more about our commercial offering on the [Enterprise](https://www.vuestorefront.io/enterprise) page.
