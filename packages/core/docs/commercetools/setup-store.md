# How to setup commercetools store with Vue Storefront?

This document will guide you through setting up a store based on our commercetools integration.

:::tip
Because this document is focused on setting up a basic working store, we omitted some of the settings. If you want to learn more see the [commercetools documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/).
:::

## Commercetools settings

First, log into your commercetools account and [create a new project](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/projects#creating-a-project). You can have more than one project with different settings and catalogs. One project can provide data for multiple selling channels.



For further information please see the [following guide](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/projects#creating-a-project)

Preparing configuration for your store consist of few steps to make it ready to use with VSF Next  
In `Project settings` menu you need to define basic settings:

</center>

##  International configuration

Select currencies available in your store:

<center>

</center>

Then, select supported languages:

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/languages.png" alt="Commercetools languages configuration" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
</center>

Next, select the available countries:

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/countries.png" alt="Commercetools countries configuration" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
</center>

Finally, set zones. Zones are helpful when few countries share the same delivery costs. You need to configure at least one shipping zone to be able to set up shipping methods later.

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/zones.png" alt="Commercetools zones configuration" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
</center>

## Taxes configuration

Open the `Settings > Project settings` menu. In the `Taxes` tab, you can configure tax rates for the countries configured in the `International` tab.

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/taxes.png" alt="Commercetools taxes configuration" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
</center>

## Shipping methods configuration

To add a shipping method, open the `Settings > Project settings` menu and select the `Shipping methods` tab. First, select if the price will be fixed (one per currency) or tiered (depending on cart value, classification, or score). For more details, see the [Shipping methods](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/project-settings#shipping-methods) page in commercetools documentation.

Then, enter specific methods for each zone and currency:

</center>

## Adding a new category

Categories allow to organize the products in groups and make them easy to find by the customer. See the [Modeling Categories](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/product-modeling/categories) page to know more about categorizing items in your store.
In order to create a category you need to:

1. Choose `add category` from the sidebar menu. 
  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/categories-sidebar-signed.png" alt="Commercetools create category first step" class="image-shadow" />
  </center>

2. Enter the name, and category order.
  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/create-category-0.png" alt="Commercetools create category first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>
3. If applicable, select the parent category to which this category belongs.
  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/create-category-1.png" alt="Commercetools create category second step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

4. Enter the slug. It will be part of the URL for this category.
  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/create-category-2.png" alt="Commercetools create category third step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

Please provide category structure with at least two levels, in order to show category page properly in VSF 2 project (one is on top, inside main menu and second level categories are shown in menu on the left).

You can see your categories in `categories search` menu:
  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/categories-search.png" alt="Commercetools create product type first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

## Adding a new product type

To create any product in commercetools, at least one product type needs to be set. It is a template with specific attributes for products of the same type. You can read more about them on the [Modeling Product Types and Attributes](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/product-modeling/product-types) page. Creating a product type involves changes in `Product types` menu:


  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/product-types-sidebar-signed.png" alt="Commercetools create product type first step" class="image-shadow" />
  </center>

1. Enter name and description.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/product-type-1.png" alt="Commercetools create product type first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>


2. Click the `Add an attribute` button and enter the name, label, constraints, and type fields.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/add-attribute.png" alt="Commercetools create product type first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

## Adding a new product

After creating at least one product type, you can add a new product. You can read more about them on the [Modeling Products](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/product-modeling/products) page.

1. Go to the `Products` page. 

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/products-sidebar-signed.png" alt="Commercetools add product first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

2. Click the `Add product` button and select the type.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/add-product-1.png" alt="Commercetools add product first step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

3. Type the name and assign the tax category.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/add-product-2.png" alt="Commercetools add product second step" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

4. Add at least one variant of the product with attribute and SKU number.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/variant.png" alt="Commercetools add product third step - choose variant" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

5. Enter a slug, keywords, and metadata to optimize searching.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/add-product-3.png" alt="Commercetools add product fourth step - SEO" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>

6. Change product status to `Published` in the top right part of the product screen.

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/product-status.png" alt="Commercetools add product fourth step - SEO" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
  </center>


### API settings

The last important step is to generate credentials for your project to connect both tools.
Go to the `developer settings` and click `Create new API client` button. After filling the `name` field choose `Project` scope in `manage` column, but please keep in mind that it use entire API for the project, so it is not recommended for production use. In that case, select only scopes that are needed.

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/developer-settings-sidebar-signed.png" alt="Commercetools set scope for client API" class="image-shadow" />
</center>


<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/api-client-1.png" alt="Commercetools set scope for client API" class="image-shadow preview-view" />
</center>


If you need more information about scopes please see [documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes).
When you click on create API you will see all the credentials. They are only displayed once, so you need to store them securely. You can download them in the format you need.

</center>

Now let's move to front-end side.

## Configuring commercetools integration in Vue Storefront

Moving to front-end site of your project, first the new VSF project should be run:

```sh
npx @vue-storefront/cli init
```
During initialization you should choose your project name and integration you use, in these case `Commercetools`.

<center>
  <img src="./images/setup-store/init-vsf.png" alt="Commercetools client API credentials" class="image-shadow" />
</center>

After entering your project catalogue, fetch all dependencies: 

```sh
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
yarn install
```

And you can now run the project with following command: 

```sh
yarn dev
```

But what you will see is the default project, because we didn't previously connect prepared Commercetools project with VSF. 
To do it, begin with credentials generated in API settings step above. They should replace default ones in `middleware.config.js` file in `ct` config object inside `integrations` property. 

```js
  integrations: {
    ct: {
      location: '@vue-storefront/commercetools-api/server',
      configuration: {
        api: {
          uri: 'https://<SHOP_DOMAIN>.com/<PROJECT_NAME>/graphql',
          authHost: 'https://<SHOP_DOMAIN>.com/<PROJECT_NAME>',
          projectKey: '<PROJECT_NAME>',
          clientId: '<CLIENT_ID>',
          clientSecret: '<CLIENT_SECRET>',
          scopes: [
            'manage_project:<PROJECT_NAME>'
          ],
        },
        currency: 'USD',
        country: 'US'
      }
    }
  }
```

For more information about available configuration options refer to the [Configuration](./configuration.md) page.

The next step is to setup `nuxt.config.js` file properly. The countries, currencies and locales should be setup simiralry like in Commercetools project, in our case: 

```js
  i18n: {
    currency: 'USD',
    country: 'US',
    countries: [
      { name: 'US',
        label: 'United States'
      },
      { name: 'DE',
        label: 'Germany' },
    ],
    currencies: [
      { name: 'USD',
        label: 'Dollar' },,
      { name: 'EUR',
        label: 'Euro' },
      
    ],
    locales: [
      {
        code: 'en',
        label: 'English',
        file: 'en.js',
        iso: 'en'
      },
      {
        code: 'de-DE',
        label: 'German',
        file: 'de.js',
        iso: 'de'
      },
    ],
  ```


:::tip
Take a closer look at above configuration and make sure all locales are set exactly like in Commercetools Merchant Center, because it's common mistake to forgot e.g. that `en` is not the same as `en-US`. 
:::


Now you can rebuild your project and run again:

```sh
yarn build
yarn dev
```

  If you follow all the previous steps you should see your project working, filled with data that you prevously setup in Commercetools project:

- on home page: 

  <center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/home-page.png" alt="Commercetools client API credentials" class="image-shadow" />
  </center>

- on category page:

<center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/category-page.png" alt="Commercetools client API credentials" class="image-shadow" />
  </center>


- and on product detail page:

<center>
    <img src="./images/setup-store/product-detail-page.png" alt="Commercetools client API credentials" class="image-shadow" />
  </center>

It is just the beginning of your VSF Next store based on Commercetools integration. Now you can customize it according to your needs.
