# Authorization

We are following [HTTP Authorization guide](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization) from commercetools documentation and using their library - [TokenProvider](https://commercetools.github.io/nodejs/sdk/api/sdkAuth.html). A token is stored in the cookie as we access it on both the client and the server-side.

You can read more about Authentication in Vue Storefront [here](/guide/authentication.html).
