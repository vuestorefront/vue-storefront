# Authorization

We are following [HTTP Authorization guide](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth) from Shopify documentation and using their library - [JS buy SDK](https://github.com/Shopify/js-buy-sdk). A token is stored in the cookie as we access it on both the client and server-side.

You can read more about Authentication in Vue Storefront [here](/guide/authentication.html).
