      comment: 'To prevent generating cookies during SSR (server-side rendering) and allowing caching, change in the `nuxt.config.js` file is required. Inside the `i18n` configuration, you should set the `detectBrowserLanguage` options to `false`. Then change the order of loaded modules. In the `buildModules` configuration, move the `@vue-storefront/__INTEGRATION__/nuxt` module before `@vue-storefront/nuxt`. Lastly, update the Vue components used to switch locales to use the `nuxt-link` component instead of the `a` tag. By default it\'s located in the `StoreLocaleSelector.vue` file.'
