# Meet Vue Storefront

Hi, nice to meet you (or see you again) ðŸ‘‹

If you are new to Vue Storefront, you should know that it's an **e-commerce frontend framework** based on [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). It can work with almost any API backend, allowing you to connect not only to e-commerce platforms but also to headless CMS, auth providers, payment gateways, and much more.

If you need proof, see the list of ready-to-use [Integrations](/integrations/) that gets longer every month.

## Why Vue Storefront

There are many reasons for using Vue Storefront in your next e-commerce project. Below, you can find some of our main strengths.

### ðŸ”Œ Extensibility

Our list of integrations is already long, but on top of it, there are hundreds of official and community-created [Nuxt Modules](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/). If you still haven't found the integration you were looking for, you can create your own, following the [Extending Vue Storefront](/integrate/extending-vue-storefront.html) guide.

### ðŸš„ Short time to market

Thanks to ready-to-use integrations, modules, and theme, you will save hundreds (if not thousands) of hours, so you can focus on creating value for your product while we do the heavy lifting.

### ðŸ’¬ Community

We have a growing community of thousands of developers. If you'd like to become a part of it or get an answer to your burning questions, join our [Discord server](https://discord.vuestorefront.io/).

### ðŸ¥ž Tech stack

The speed and flexibility of Vue Storefront wouldn't be possible without the great technologies that power it:

* [Vue.js 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide)
* [Nuxt.js 2](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started)
* [Storefront UI](https://www.storefrontui.io/) (optional)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home) (optional)
